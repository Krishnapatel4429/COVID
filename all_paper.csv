Our aim was to determine whether carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels in the first 3 days after birth reflected abnormal EtCO 2 levels in the delivery suite, and hence, a prolonged rather than an early insult resulted in IVH. In addition, we determined if greater EtCO 2 level fluctuations during resuscitation occurred in infants who developed IVH. EtCO 2 levels during delivery suite resuscitation and CO 2 levels on the neonatal unit were evaluated in 58 infants (median gestational age 27.3 weeks). Delta EtCO 2 was the difference between the highest and lowest level of EtCO 2 . Thirteen infants developed a grade 3-4 IVH (severe group). There were no significant differences in CO 2 levels between those who did and did not develop an IVH (or severe IVH) on the NICU. The delta EtCO 2 during resuscitation differed between infants with any IVH (6.2 (5.4-7.5) kPa) or no IVH (3.8 (2.7-4.3) kPA) (p < 0.001) after adjusting for differences in gestational age. Delta EtCO 2 levels gave an area under the ROC curve of 0.940 for prediction of IVH.

Almost 20 years ago, an essay by Sitia and Meldolesi first listed what was known at the time about domain formation within the ER. In the time that has passed since, additional ER domains have been discovered and characterized. These include the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), the ER quality control compartment (ERQC), where ER-associated degradation (ERAD) occurs, and the plasma membrane-associated membrane (PAM). Insight has been gained into the separation of nuclear envelope proteins from the remainder of the ER. Research has also shown that the biogenesis of peroxisomes and lipid droplets occurs on specialized membranes of the ER. Several studies have shown the existence of specific marker proteins found on all these domains and how they are targeted there. Moreover, a first set of cytosolic ER-associated sorting proteins, including phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2) and Rab32 have been identified. Intra-ER targeting mechanisms appear to be superimposed onto ER retention mechanisms and rely on transmembrane and cytosolic sequences. The crucial roles of ER domain formation for cell physiology are highlighted with the specific targeting of the tumor metastasis regulator gp78 to ERAD-mediating membranes or of the promyelocytic leukemia protein to the MAM.	Research during the past 2 decades has revealed that the ER resembles a city with multiple functions assigned to designated areas more than a village that specializes into one function. B cell to plasma cell development is just one example that shows the dynamic nature of ER domain formation and targeting. Together, multiple findings highlight the importance of understanding intra-ER targeting for human disease. Given that this area of cell biology is in some ways the final frontier of intracellular sorting, great progress is expected to occur during the next decade with important insight into the biogenesis of the ER as a complex assembly of membrane domains and into the significance of this organelle for human life and death. An important question for future research will be to elucidate the connection of vesicular trafficking to ER domain formation, given the multiple involvements of COP coats, Rab proteins and Arf GTPases in this cell biological mechanism. |

3	86a998617c077f4fe2ab26214995a3548fbc0fc5	Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome	The recent emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, a close relative of the Severe Acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, both of which caused a lethal respiratory infection in humans, reinforces the need for further understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis and the host immune response. These viruses have evolved diverse strategies to evade and block host immune responses, facilitating infection and transmission. Pathogenesis following infection with these viruses is characterized by a marked delay in the induction of Type I interferon (IFN I) and, subsequently, by a poor adaptive immune response. Therapies that expedite IFN I induction as well as interventions that antagonize immunoevasive virus proteins are thus promising candidates for immune modulation.	• MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have evolved effective immune evasion strategies. Signaling of MAVS results in activation of various kinases, which phosphorylate IRF3, resulting in its dimerization and trafficking to the nucleus for inducing IFN I production. IFN I thus produced will signal through IFNα/β receptor resulting in its phosphorylation by JAK1 and TYK1. This will result in STAT1/STAT2 complex formation, activation and localization into the nucleus using import factors such as karyopherin α1 (Kα1) and karyopherin α2 (Kα2), which will activate various interferon stimulated response elements (ISREs) to bring about an antiviral state. As depicted in the schematic, CoVs have developed strategies to evade/inhibit host innate immune functions, some of which are specific to SARS-CoV [26] (blue) and MERS-CoV (magenta) and some which are shared between the two viruses (red). Nsp1 inhibits phosphorylation of STAT1, promotes host gene mRNA degradation, and also inhibits host mRNA translation. Nsp3 interacts with IRF3, inhibiting its phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation. Nsp16 renders the virus unrecognizable by cellular sensors MDA5 and RIG-I. N protein inhibits AP1 and NFκB signaling and PKR function. |

Evaluation for a special pathogen is resource intensive. We report an innovative approach to home assessment that, in collaboration with public health, enables safe evaluation and specimen collection outside the healthcare setting, avoiding unnecessary exposures and resource utilization.	Our hospital has a long history of collaborating closely with Public Health on routinely occurring and emerging infectious disease responses. The use of home assessment teams in the setting of novel infectious disease epidemics demonstrates the value of integrated and coordinated public health and healthcare systems and corresponding benefits to our patients and the public.|

International aviation is growing rapidly, resulting in rising aviation greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns about the growth trajectory of the industry and emissions have led to calls for market measures such as emissions trading and carbon levies to be introduced to restrict demand and prompt innovation. This paper provides an overview of the science on aviation's contribution to climate change, analyses key trends in the industry since 1990, projects international civil aviation emissions to 2025 and analyses the emission intensity improvements that are necessary to offset rising international demand. The findings suggest international aviation carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions will increase by more than 110 per cent between 2005 and 2025 (from 416 Mt to between 876 and 1013 Mt) and that it is unlikely emissions could be stabilised at levels consistent with risk averse climate targets without restricting demand.	Stabilising international aviation emissions at levels consistent with risk averse climate targets without restricting demand will be extremely difficult.

Historic and projected emission intensity improvements 1996-2025. more than 100 per cent between 2005 and 2025, the emission intensity of international aviation would have to fall by 32 per cent, requiring an average annual decrease of 1.9 per cent. To stabilise emissions at 2005 levels, the emission intensity would have to be improved by 65 per cent, necessitating an average annual decrease of 5.2 per cent. With current technology, emission intensity improvements of this magnitude appear unlikely. Further action on international aviation emissions is likely to be necessary if the international community wants to keep the increase in the global average surface temperature to less than 2 1C. Under current policy settings, emissions are likely to increase significantly unless there is a major global economic downturn or other shock to the aviation market.|

Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonates and evaluation of their activity against a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. Two acyclic nucleoside phosphonates within the series, namely 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]xanthine (PMEX) and 9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]xanthine (HPMPX), were shown to possess activity against several human herpesviruses. The most potent compound was PMEX, a xanthine analogue of adefovir (PMEA). PMEX exhibited a single digit mM activity against VZV (EC 50 ¼ 2.6 mM, TK þ Oka strain) and HCMV (EC 50 ¼ 8.5 mM, Davis strain), while its hexadecyloxypropyl monoester derivative was active against HSV-1 and HSV-2 (EC 50 values between 1.8 and 4.0 mM). In contrast to acyclovir, PMEX remained active against the TK -VZV 07-1 strain with EC 50 ¼ 4.58 mM. PMEX was suggested to act as an inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase and represents the first reported xanthine-based acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with potent antiviral properties.	The inhibitory effects of PMEXpp on human (a and b) and viral (VZV and HCMV) DNA polymerases were determined as previously described using activated calf thymus DNA, 100 mM of each of the three unlabeled dNTPs, and 0.5 mM of the rate limiting tritiumlabeled dNTP, and serial dilutions of PMEXpp (21) . Foscarnet pyrophosphate and acyclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP) were included as the reference compound. The 50% inhibitory concentration or compound concentration required to inhibit the polymerase-catalyzed DNA synthesis by 50% was then determined.|
10	304a6f893c12b837b18908ead759245d221b2087		Objective: To compare	The power of the present study in a limited number of septic shock patients was clearly insufficient to evaluate possible impact of the ω-3 vs. the ω-6 lipid infusions on clinical course of disease, including development of organ failure and death. However, the two alternative regimens for lipid-based parenteral nutrition exerted differential influence on key variables of inflammatory mediator generation and neutrophil function, both intimately involved in pathogenetic sequelae of sepsis. Under ω-6 lipid infusion both the predominance of high plasma free AA levels and impairment of neutrophil functions persisted or became even more prominent. In contrast, the lipid mediator precursor profile in the plasma was rapidly shifted towards predominance of ω-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in patients receiving a fish oil based lipid emulsion. Concomitantly, partial restoration of ex vivo analyzed neutrophil functions was noted, significantly different from the ω-6 infusion group. Lipid emulsions enriched in ω-3 instead of ω-6 fatty acids may thus offer the possibility to combine parenteral nutrition with differential impact on inflammatory variables and neutrophil function in septic patients.|

Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein with the host cell receptor is recognized as the first step of infection and is the main determinant of virus tropism. The mechanisms by which neutralizing antibodies inhibit PEDV have not been defined. Isolating PEDV neutralizing antibodies are crucial to identifying the receptor-binding domains of the viral spike and elucidating the mechanism of protection against PEDV infection. Methods: B cell hybridoma technique was used to generate hybridoma cells that secrete specific antibodies. E.coli prokaryotic expression system and Bac-to-Bac expression system were used to identify the target protein of each monoclonal antibody. qPCR was performed to analyze PEDV binding to Vero E6 cells with neutralizing antibody. Results: We identified 10 monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology. Remarkably, 4 mAbs (designed 2G8, 2B11, 3D9, 1E3) neutralized virus infection potently, of which 2B11 and 1E3 targeted the conformational epitope of the PEDV S protein. qPCR results showed that both 2B11 and 2G8 blocked virus entry into Vero cells. Conclusion: The data suggested that PEDV neutralizing antibody inhibited virus infection by binding to infectious virions, which could work as a tool to find the receptor-binding domains.	Then anti-SP mAb 2B11 and 2G8 with the strongest neutralizing capacity were selected to explore the mechanism of nAbs. As previously reported, PEDV For the 37°C attachment, PEDV was first incubated with antibody for 1 h and then added to cells for 1 h infection incubation at 37°C. For the 4°C attachment, PEDV was initially incubated with Vero cells for 1 h at 4°C, and antibody was then added to the PEDV-cell culture and the temperature was increased to 37°C for 1 h infection incubation. The cell-associated PEDV was quantified by viral RNA RT-qPCR. 9G11 was set as an isotype control. b Comparison of epitopes between 2G8 and 2B11 nAbs using a competition ELISA test. 2G8 was used as a competitor, and 9G11 was used as a negative control. The results are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). Differences were considered significant if the P value was < 0.05. P values are indicated as follows: *P < 0.05; ***P < 0.001 enters Vero cells via an initial endocytic uptake, and subsequently, the virus fuses with the PEDV S and host endosomal membrane [40] . The virus only attaches cell, but doesn't have fusion with cell membrane at 4°C. We found 2G8 and anti-SP mAb 2B11 efficiently bound PEDV, and then inhibited virus entry into cell at 37°C. But if the experiment was designed into two-time points, virus infected the cells at 4°C for 1 h, and then the mAb was added at 37°C for 1 h, the results showed that virus could invade and replicate in cells, and the copies of virus in infected-cells had no difference regardless of the presence of 2G8, anti-SP mAb 2B11 and PEDV-negative serum. However, positive serum didn't prevent the proliferation of intracellular viruses. This may be due to the lack of mAb in positive serum which neutralized the virus inside the cell or the interaction of mAbs makes some mAbs lose the ability of neutralization intracellular or there may exist other possible mechanisms. These results demonstrated if the viral have attached to the target cells, neutralization of 2G8 and anti-SP mAb 2B11 doesn't work. It seems that PEDV infected cells apparently lower at 4°C than 37°C regardless of any antibodies, indicating that PEDV is more efficiently taken up by cells through endocytosis at 37°C than at 4°C. This is consistent with that the virus uptake more efficiently through endocytosis at 37°C than at 4°C, which was observed in Herpes simplex virus 1 infection [41] . The epitope targeted by 2G8 is completely distinct from anti-SP mAb 2B11, there may be at least two mechanisms involved neutralization effects by directly inhibiting binding to an epitope.|

AF was calculated as the ratio of the fraction of species in the aerosol compartment to either the bulk water or SSML compartment using both read-based phylogenies from Kraken and draft genome data. Surface enrichment factors were similarly calculated using species fractions ratios of SSML to bulk seawater. To make comparisons of individual species more manageable, the free bacteria data set was further trimmed. Species were sorted by AF and 20 species were selected at random for the following values: AF > 5, AF 1.5-5, AF 1 to 1.5, AF ≈ 1, AF 0.667-1, AF 0.20-0.667, AF < 0.2. To ensure all abundant species were included, this was amended with the top 50 abundant species resulting in 197 bacteria species. This set was further utilized for coverage analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed in PhyloT (http://phylot.biobyte.de/) and visualized in iTOL (http://itol.embl.de/) 73 . Species were annotated with corresponding AF data to compare phylogeny and aerosolization patterns.|

However, safety, attenuation and immunization outcomes of current vaccines are not guaranteed. Several studies indicate that attenuated IBV vaccine strains contribute to the emergence of variant viruses in the field due to mutations and recombination. Therefore, there is a need to develop a stable and safe IBV vaccine that will not create variant viruses. In this study, we generated recombinant Newcastle disease viruses (rNDVs) expressing the S1, S2 and S proteins of IBV using reverse genetics technology. Our results showed that the rNDV expressing the S protein of IBV provided better protection than the rNDV expressing S1 or S2 protein of IBV, indicating that the S protein is the best protective antigen of IBV. Immunization of 4-week-old SPF chickens with the rNDV expressing S protein elicited IBV-specific neutralizing antibodies and provided complete protection against virulent IBV and virulent NDV challenges. These results suggest that the rNDV expressing the S protein of IBV is a safe and effective bivalent vaccine candidate for both IBV and NDV.	Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed among groups by One-Way-ANOVA test. The student t-test was used to compare two groups. To avoid bias, all animal experiments were designed as blinded studies.|

Of the 75 taxa of Habronattus and outgroups studied, 47 have X 1 X 2 0 sex chromosomes in males, 10 have X 1 X 2 Y, 15 have X 1 X 2 X 3 Y, 2 have X0, and one has both X 1 X 2 0 and X 1 X 2 X 3 Y. Chromosome numbers and behavior suggest neo-Ys formed by an autosome-X fusion to make X 1 X 2 Y, with a second fusion to an autosome to make X 1 X 2 X 3 Y. Phylogeny shows at least 8-15 gains (or possibly some losses) of neo-Y (i.e., X-autosome fusions), a remarkable number for such a small clade. In contrast to the many X-autosome fusions, at most one autosome-autosome fusion is indicated. Origins of neo-Y are correlated significantly with distal localization of chiasmata, supporting White's hypothesis that evolution of neo-Y systems is facilitated by looser pairing (distal chiasmata) at meiosis. However, an alternative (or contributing) explanation for the correlation is that X-autosome fusions were selected to permit isolation of male-favored alleles to the neo-Y chromosome, aided by distal chiasmata limiting recombination. This intralocus sexual conflict hypothesis could explain both the many X-autosome fusions, and the stunning complexity of male Habronattus courtship displays.

Recent findings suggest that lncRNAs play various regulatory roles in multiple major biological and pathological processes. During viral life cycles, lncRNAs are involved in a series of steps, including enhancing viral gene expression, promoting viral replication and genome packaging, boosting virion release, maintaining viral latency and assisting viral transformation; additionally, lncRNAs antagonize host antiviral innate immune responses. In contrast to proteins that function in viral infection, lncRNAs are expected to be novel targets for the modulation of all types of biochemical processes due to their broad characteristics and profound influence. This review highlights our current understanding of the regulatory roles of lncRNAs during viral infection processes with an emphasis on the potential usefulness of lncRNAs as a target for viral intervention strategies, which could have therapeutic implications for the application of a clinical approach for the treatment of viral diseases.	In this review, we have thoroughly described the biological roles of lncRNAs in enhancing viral gene expression, promoting viral replication and genome packaging, boosting virion release, maintaining viral latency, assisting viral transformation, and antagonizing the host antiviral innate immune response. More importantly, in view of their regulatory roles, lncRNAs have been regarded as targets to block the facilitation of viral infection. Since the viral life cycle and the mechanism of the host antiviral response are clearer, targeting lncRNAs for prophylactic or therapeutic ends is an attractive alternative. With further advances in our understanding of the molecular details that govern the viral life cycle and immune response, this review hopefully revealed information that will help expand viral intervention strategies.|

The study included 11 subjects having developed a fever, and 13 subjects not having a fever, and 20 control subjects. Immunoglobulins were measured by nephelometry, and HSP70 and ghrelins by appropriate ELISA tests. The level of ghrelin was reduced, while the level of HSP70 was significantly increased in subjects who developed fevers. When temperatures were normalized, both levels were found similar to the control group. These results indicate that the increase in serum immunoglobulins levels associated with vaccinations, along with, elevations in HSP70 and reduced ghrelin levels associated with fever, may be the important parameters in the clinical evaluation and follow-up of treatments with vaccines.	In conclusion, the increase in serum levels of IgM, IgA, IgG seen in patients after vaccination relative to their levels before the swine flu vaccinations and those in the controls indicated that the vaccination stimulates the humoral immune system. Serum HSP70 significantly increased in the patients who developed fever after being vaccinated. Serum ghrelin levels fell significantly until the first month post-vaccination sample. The decrease in serum ghrelin levels was more marked in the patients who developed fever, with the levels falling back after the fever disappeared than those seen in patients who did not develop a fever. The results indicate that the increase in serum levels IgM, IgA, and IgG levels, elevation of HSP70 associated with fever, and reduced ghrelin levels can be important parameters in the clinical evaluation and follow-up of vaccinations. These findings could also be used in clinical or preclinical trials to develop vaccines that are less likely to induce fever, and also provide some information as to whether the rather intensive blood-drawing schedule would seem to rule out any use in ''routine'' practice of vaccination.

Many of these promote virus-specific translation by use of molecular tags on viral mRNA such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and genome-linked viral proteins (VPg) that bind translation machinery components in unusual ways and promote RNA circularization. This review describes recent advances in understanding some of the mechanisms in which animal virus mRNAs gain an advantage over cellular transcripts, including new structural and biochemical insights into IRES function and novel proteins that function as alternate met-tRNA i met carriers in translation initiation. Comparisons between animal and plant virus mechanisms that promote translation of viral mRNAs are discussed.	Some viruses may use long range RNA interactions to modulate translation Schematic depiction of translation initiation and the eIF2 nucleotide exchange cycle. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4F, which consists of the cap binding protein (eIF4E), a scaffolding protein (eIF4G) and an RNA helicase (eIF4A), recognizes the m 7 G cap structure. The mRNA can circularize in accordance with the closed-loop model via interaction between PABP at the 3′ terminus and eIF4G complexed with the 5′ cap. Next, the 43S preinitiation complex, composed of the 40S small ribosomal subunit and initiation factors eIF1, eIF1A, heterotrimeric eIF2(α,β,γ), eIF5 and multisubunit eIF3, can bind the mRNA via interaction between eIF3 and eIF4G to form the 48S complex. eIF2 delivers the initiator methionyl tRNA as a ternary complex, comprised of eIF2•GTP•met-tRNA i met . The 40S ribosomal subunit then scans to locate the AUG codon where the 60S joins, some factors are ejected including eIF2, and the 80S ribosome enters the elongation phase of protein synthesis (reviewed in [109] ). eIF2 activity relies on GTP hydrolysis and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B must recycle GTP•eIF2 before it can be used in subsequent rounds of translation initiation (depicted by the eIF2:GTP exchange cycle). Several kinases have been identified that act on eIF2 to inhibit met-tRNA i met delivery by phosphorylating eIF2α, which include: PKR, a double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase typically activated during infection by RNA viruses in animals, PERK, which is activated in response to ER stress, HRI, a heme-sensing molecule, and GCN2, which senses nutrient availability. Initiation on virus internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). Virus IRESs use various noncanonical interactions with initiation factors and/or the 40S ribosome subunit. eIF4E is not involved in the binding of viral IRESs shown. Type 1 and 2 IRESs bind the central heat domain of eIF4GI in an analogous position and orientation on stem loop structures adjacent to conserved oligopyrimidine-spacer-AUG motifs (Yn-Xm-AUG) at the 3′ border of the IRES elements. The AUG codon basepairs with the initiator tRNA delivered by eIF2. eIF4GI binding is stimulated by eIF4A and modulated by PTB, which binds the same stemloop structure as eIF4GI in Type 1 IRESs and binds a more diffuse footprint of RNA domains in Type 2 IRESs [31,33]. PV Type 1 IRES requires SRp20 for PCBP2 ITAF function and may play a role in bridging the IRES to the 43S complex [26] . Type 3 IRESs and the unclassified HIV2 IRES utilize interactions between eIF3 and 40S. The HCV pseudoknot (shaded in grey) positions the initiation codon (green box) in the mRNA binding cleft of the 40S subunit [36] and the apical stem loops of domain III interact directly with eIF3 [110] [111] [112] . HIV2 IRES contains 4 domains conserved among primate lentiviruses (shaded, P3, P4, P2-P5). HIV2 IRES can bind 48S preiniation complexes at three AUGs (green boxes) [16] ; however, eIF1 is not found in these complexes [37] . eIF5B and other eIF2-independent mechanisms for translation initiation. A. The crystal structure of archaeal IF2/eIF5B is organized into 4 highly conserved domains (labeled 1-IV). B. Mammalian eIF5B contains the C-terminal half that is homologous to archaeal IF2 and a N-terminal regulatory domain whose structure is unknown that is removed by PV 3Cpro cleavage. C. Infection and stress activate eIF2α kinases that reduce concentrations of eIF2•GTP•met-tRNA i met ternary complex, inhibiting translation from viral IRES elements. PV and HCV may overcome this restriction by recruiting alternate proteins to help deliver met-tRNA i met in GTP-dependent or GTP-independent mechanisms.|

All athymic and euthymic pups (57/57) from immune dams remained clinically normal, whereas 51 of 66 athymic and euthymic pups from non-immune dams died within 30 days. Infectious RV was detected by explant culture in 12 of 15 surviving pups of both genotypes from non-immune dams 30 days after inoculation, but in none of the 57 surviving pups from immune dams. RV-Y DNA was detected by Southern blotting in kidneys of surviving athymic pups from non-immune dams but was not detected in pups from immune dams. Euthymic pups from immune dams appeared not to produce endogenous antibody to RV after virus challenge, whereas euthymic pups from non-immune dams produced high-titered RV immune serum. Pups of both genotypes given immune serum prior to or with RV were fully protected from disease and persistent infection, whereas pups given immune serum 24 hours after RV were partially protected. These studies show that RV antibody offers significant protection against lethal and persistent RV infection.	This study reinforces the concept that pre-existing antibody can provide protection against infection for rats born in an enzootically infected colony [8] . It also suggests that vaccination of dams and sires prior to breeding could be useful for prevention, control or elimination of RV infection. Inactivated vaccines have been employed successfully to prevent parvovirus infection in other species [1, 10] , but the possibility of vaccination with an attenuated rat parvovirus or a heterologous rodent parvovirus of low virulence such as minute virus of mice [13] should also be considered.|

International interests in bioaerosols have increased rapidly to broaden the pool of knowledge on their identification, quantification, distribution, and health impacts (e.g., infectious and respiratory diseases, allergies, and cancer). However, risk assessment of bioaerosols based on conventional culture methods has been hampered further by several factors such as: (1) the complexity of microorganisms or derivatives to be investigated; (2) the purpose, techniques, and locations of sampling; and (3) the lack of valid quantitative criteria (e.g., exposure standards and dose/effect relationships). Although exposure to some microbes is considered to be beneficial for health, more research is needed to properly assess their potential health hazards including inter-individual susceptibility, interactions with non-biological agents, and many proven/ unproven health effects (e.g., atopy and atopic diseases).

25	7f1d647d43af4ed96625ed113f8bf0ab737e2f0c	Severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine development: experiences of vaccination against avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus	Vaccines against infectious bronchitis of chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) have arguably been the most successful, and certainly the most widely used, of vaccines for diseases caused by coronaviruses, the others being against bovine, canine, feline and porcine coronaviruses. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), together with the genetically related coronaviruses of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), is a group 3 coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus being tentatively in group 4, the other known mammalian coronaviruses being in groups 1 and 2. IBV replicates not only in respiratory tissues (including the nose, trachea, lungs and airsacs, causing respiratory disease), but also in the kidney (associated with minor or major nephritis), oviduct, and in many parts of the alimentary tract * /the oesophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, bursa of Fabricius, caecal tonsils, rectum and cloaca, usually without clinical effects. The virus can persist, being re-excreted at the onset of egg laying (4 to 5 months of age), believed to be a consequence of the stress of coming into lay. Genetic lines of chickens differ in the extent to which IBV causes mortality in chicks, and in respect of clearance of the virus after the acute phase. Live attenuated (by passage in chicken embryonated eggs) IBV strains were introduced as vaccines in the 1950s, followed a couple of decades later by inactivated vaccines for boosting protection in egg-laying birds. Live vaccines are usually applied to meat-type chickens at 1 day of age. In experimental situations this can result in sterile immunity when challenged by virulent homologous virus. Although 100% of chickens may be protected (against clinical signs and loss of ciliary activity in trachea), sometimes 10% of vaccinated chicks may not respond with a protective immune response. Protection is short lived, the start of the decline being apparent 9 weeks after vaccination with vaccines based on highly attenuated strains. IBV exists as scores of serotypes (defined by the neutralization test), cross-protection often being poor. Consequently, chickens may be revaccinated, with the same or another serotype, two or three weeks later. Single applications of inactivated virus has generally led to protection of B/50% of chickens. Two applications have led to 90 to 100% protection in some reports, but remaining below 50% in others. In practice in the field, inactivated vaccines are used in laying birds that have previously been primed with two or three live attenuated virus vaccinations. This increases protection of the laying birds against egg production losses and induces a sustained level of serum antibody, which is passed to progeny. The large spike glycoprotein (S) comprises a carboxy-terminal S2 subunit (approximately 625 amino acid residues), which anchors S in the virus envelope, and an amino-terminal S1 subunit (approximately 520 residues), believed to largely form the distal bulbous part of S. The S1 subunit (purified from IBV virus, expressed using baculovirus or expressed in birds from a fowlpoxvirus vector) induced virus neutralizing antibody. Although protective immune responses were induced, multiple inoculations were required and the percentage of protected chickens was too low ( B/50%) for commercial application. Remarkably, expression of S1 in birds using a non-pathogenic fowl adenovirus vector induced protection in 90% and 100% of chickens in two experiments. Differences of as little as 5% between the S1 sequences can result in poor cross-protection. Differences in S1 of 2 to 3% (10 to 15 amino acids) can change serotype, suggesting that a small number of epitopes are immunodominant with respect to neutralizing antibody. Initial studies of the role of the IBV nucleocapsid protein (N) in immunity suggested that immunization with	En conclusió n, las vacunas vivas atenuadas inducen una buena protecció n, aunque de corta duración, frente a la infección experimental homó loga, pero una minoría de individuos puede responder pobremente. Las vacunas de IBV inactivadas no son suficientemente eficaces cuando se administran únicamente una vez y no se realiza una primovacunación con una vacuna viva. Dos aplicaciones de una vacuna inactivada de IBV son mucho más eficaces, aunque no parece una propuesta viable desde el punto de vista comercial para la industria avícola. Aún así, el coste y la logística de una aplicación mú ltiple de una vacuna inactivada frente al SARS serían más aceptables para la protecció n de una población humana, especialmente si está limitada a grupos de alto riesgo, como trabajadores relacionados con temas sanitarios o personas con alto riesgo de contacto. La aplicación de la vacuna frente al SARS es quizás mejor limitarla a un nú mero de individuos de riesgo que puedan ser monitorizados, ya que algunas personas vacunadas podrían, al estar infectadas con el coronavirus del SARS, volverse excretores asintomáticos del virus, siendo un riesgo para la población no vacunada. De cara a un futuro próximo, la alta eficacia de un vector de adenovirus aviar que expresa la subunidad S1 del IBV proporciona optimismo con respecto a una vacuna viva de SARS, y si se cree necesario podría haber la posibilidad de incluir el gen de la proteína N.|

Herein we review latest developments that use nanomaterials for vaccines. By highlighting the relationships between the nanoscale physicochemical characteristics and working mechanisms of nanomaterials, this paper shows the current status of the developments where researchers employ functional nanomaterials as vector and/or immunoregulators for vaccines. It also provides us some clues for improving the design and application of nanomaterials to optimize the effi cacy of vaccines.	Considering the obvious advantages of nanomaterials for optimizing the effi cacy of vaccines, uncovering the inner relations between their physicochemical characteristics and biological effects would be an important direction in their following research and development. It is certainly useful for broadening vaccine-based prophylaxis and therapy against diseases in the future. Moreover, the structure and surface modifi cation of the nanomaterials might be changed when they enter a body because of their bindings with proteins in vivo. Such changes should be the subject of intense investigations in the future. Thus, how to maintain the stability of nanomaterials should become another important issue in the fi eld of developing functional nanomaterials for vaccines.|

To characterize polyadenylation activity in the BaMV replicase complex, we performed the in vitro polyadenylation with various BaMV templates. We conducted a polyadenylation activity assay for BaMV RNA by using a partially purified BaMV replicase complex. The results showed that approximately 200 adenylates at the 3′ end of the RNA were generated on the endogenous RNA templates. Specific fractions derived from uninfected Nicotiana benthamiana plants enhanced the polyadenylation activity, implying that host factors are involved in polyadenylation. Furthermore, polyadenylation can be detected in newly synthesized plus-strand RNA in vitro when using the exogenous BaMV minus-strand minigenome. For polyadenylation on the exogenous plus-strand minigenome, the 3′ end requires at least 4A to reach 22% polyadenylation activity. The results indicate that the BaMV replicase complex recognizes the 3′ end of BaMV for polyadenylation.	Head-to-tail ligation of viral RNA products and sequence analysis of the 3′ end RNA RNAs extracted from in vitro exogenous RNA replication assay were dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and followed by phosphorylation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA). Before head-to-tail ligation, the RNAs were denatured at 95 1C for 5 min and then quick-chilled on ice. The denatured RNAs were added to 1 ml of 10x ligase buffer and 1 U of T4 RNA ligase 1 (NEB) in a total of 10 ml reaction, and the mixture was incubated at 16 1C for 16 h. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the ligated RNAs were converted into cDNA with ImProm-II™ Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and Ba-77 (5′GGGCGATTGTAGGGGA3′) priming at nt 62-77 in plus strand of BaMV. The cDNAs were further amplified by PCR for 35 cycles using forward primer BaSat+607, reverse primer Ba-21 (5′GTTTCGTTTGGAGTGGTT3′) corresponding to nt 4-21 of BaMV, and GoTaqs Flexi DNA Polymerase (Promega). The PCR products were sequenced after cloning into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega).|

The PM approach focuses on the characterization of different phenotypes and pathogenic pathways in order to allow the selection of specific biomarkers that will be useful in disease management. Rhinitis is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disease, both in terms of underlying endotypes and clinical presentations. Therefore, to apply the PM principles to the various rhinitis subtypes rise as a meaningful strategy to improve evaluation and treatment. Recent Findings The technology of recombinant allergens has allowed molecular characterization of IgE reactivity of specific individual components of allergenic extracts. Recently published and ongoing clinical trials based on component resolved diagnosis (CRD) bring more precision to allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis. Monoclonal antibodies against various cytokines involved in inflammatory allergic and nonallergic rhinitis endotypes show promissory results. Summary Better understanding of pathogenic pathways together with an accurate phenotype classification of patients presented with rhinitis symptoms contributes to point out clinical usefulness of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools, which leads to more accurate environmental control measures, personalized pharmacologic options, and new biological therapy developments.

The present study builds on the recently developed ""Fear of COVID-19 Scale"" (Ahorsu et al., In International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8, 2020). The sample comprised of 850 participants, male and female young adults from Russia and Belarus. The majority of survey participants are university students and graduates. Females, students, and others from Russia report higher levels of COVID-19-related fear than those from Belarus. Respondents from Russia and Belarus report less fear than people from Iran who were surveyed earlier. The scale used for the present survey evidenced a good Cronbach's Alpha measure of internal consistency or reliability (0.809). Clearly, further research is needed across locations and over time about the nature and extent of fear caused by COVID 19. Overall, the FCV-19S appears to be a valuable and brief instrument that may provide useful information for intervention and policy purposes to migrate fear and problem behavior linked to infectious disease outbreaks."	Efforts, worldwide, are moving toward addressing the impact of COVID-19. Understanding and mitigating human fear including that linked to physical and mental health is a major concern and focal point for intervention (Smith 2006) . Clearly, the results of this study evidence the variation of fear by gender, religion, religiosity, academic status, and country factors. These results are preliminary, taken at one point in time across two countries in Eastern Europe-Russia and Belarus. Scale results from Iran and those from Russia and Belarus were collected at different times where government responses to COVID-19 vary along with the nature of public information available about the infectious disease. Therefore, caution should be exercised regarding comparisons and conclusions about COVID-19 fear and its impact. The authors of the FCV-19S (Ahorsu et al. 2020) are to be commended for their efforts to develop a simple, short, and valid survey instrument-an important, timely, and highly relevant undertaking. The useful information generated by FCV-19S should be used in applied ways. For example, the findings may be relevant for online training of trainers who, in turn, may work with others to help prevent or reduce COVID-19 fear, stress, and anxiety causing problem behavior such as harmful substance use, domestic violence, and crime. Also, sources of information (e.g., tips sheets on helpful ways of coping) disseminated online or by other means should be considered for intervention purposes. Clearly, future research is needed, across locations and over time, to learn more about the utility of the FCV-19S for intervention and policy purposes.|

One hundred and three serum or plasma samples were selected and tested: 70 were positive by both tests, 24 were negative by both tests. The in-practice test produced five false positive and four false negative results. The sensitivity of the in-practice test was 95% and the specificity was 83%. When the titres were compared it was found that the in-practice test results were significantly correlated with IFA titres but the degree of correlation was not likely to be clinically useful. The IFA titres of the four false negative samples were found to be low (less than 40) which suggests that even a cat with a false negative result is still unlikely to be excreting FCoV.	In conclusion, the performance of the FCoV Immunocomb compared favourably with the IFA test and it should be useful in the investigation of suspected FIP cases and in screening cats before entry into FCoV-free households. However, caution should be exercised in attempting to correlate its titres with those obtained by IFA.|
34	cb0ded8280d8d5c506677cefc038f4da9f62045b			Supportive care in severely ill patients is critical in leptospirosis. Careful fluid resuscitation should be given in patients with hypovolaemic shock. Inotropic drug administration should be given to patients with refractory shock despite effective fluid replacement. Haemodialysis should be started early in patients with hypercatabolic renal injury. Daily haemofiltration or dialysis may be needed in some patients, and renal replacement should be continued until clear improvement. Bleeding precautions are needed; however, routine use of proton-pump inhibitors and H2 blockers is not recommended and should be used with caution, especially in patients who are intubated, as they may increase the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Respiratory support is mandatory in patients with respiratory failure either from ARDS or severe pulmonary haemorrhage. Ventilation should be supervised in the intensive care unit care to maintain adequate oxygenation. The use of high-dose steroids is not indicated and may be harmful predisposing to superimposed bacterial infections. 26 |

36	1b21584116d57c12aad732ac4d83da8b6aab681b		Governments are increasingly emphasizing emergency management in response to public emergencies that cause extensive consequences and involve multiple government agencies. One of the influential measures adopted by governments is the establishment of cross-agency networks. Scholars have validated the importance of cross-agency collaboration and networks, but only a few studies have examined cross-agency information sharing and utilization mechanism of joint emergency actions. Inspired by the theory of network embeddedness, we study the joint effects of informational and task attributes of embeddedness and absorptive capacity of the leading agency on collaborative emergency capacity. Our data consist of 110 local government contingency plans collected from F District in Shanghai, China. We found that a well-structured cross-agency network and a leading department with great information accessibility will significantly affect the efficiency of emergency collaborations. The capacity to absorb information significantly enhances the improvement of emergency collaboration.	However, this study has several limitations. First, we measured network flexibility and efficiency via perceptual measures of the emergency management plan. Although the plan is important, flexibility and efficiency of the plan's implementation in real emergencies require future study. Second, the current study lacks external validity due to data sampling. External validity comprises situational validity and sampling validity. Regarding situational validity, this study can pass with a good score because it includes all contingency plans for various scenarios. For sampling validity, further inspection should be conducted because we only gathered contingency plans from F district, which is one of the 16 districts in Shanghai. Given that each district may have different measures in emergency management, the result of this study may be challenged when scaling up to a wide range. Furthermore, this study disregarded the personal embeddedness of department managers, which can include professional friendship ties internal and external to the government. Lastly, we only measured the absorptive capacity of the lead government department and overlooked the absorptive capacity of other departments or nongovernmental organizations. In addition, the level of absorptive capacity can change, for example, by shifting from high to low or low to high over time. The influence of this change on the network dynamics and outcome is worthy of further research.|

Ten conventionally reared pigs showing acute clinical signs of PMWS were selected from a farm on which animal were seronegative to porcine reproductive and respiratory virus and to Aujeszky's disease virus. All pigs were positive in tests for porcine circovirus type 2 by ISH and IHC. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to CD3, CD79a, CD45RA (3C3/9), lysozyme, SLA-II-DQ (BL2H5), and MAC387 were used to characterise cells in PMWS lesions. The most relevant changes were reduction or loss of B and T lymphocytes, increased numbers of macrophages, and partial loss and redistribution of antigen presenting cells throughout lymphoid tissues compared to uninfected controls. The characteristics of lymphoid lesions in the present study strongly suggest an immunosuppressive effect of PMWS in affected pigs. #	Unlike other viral diseases such as hog cholera or PRRS that provoke transitory suppression of the immune system (Drew, 2000; Summerfield et al., 2000) , PMWS shows severe unique lymphoid lesions (Rosell et al., 1999) . PCV2 have been confirmed as the causal agent of these lesions and the disease can be reproduced by this virus alone Harms et al., 2001) . Further characterisations of lymphoid lesions of this study support the hypothesis that PMWS affected pig are immunosuppressed (Sarli et al., 2001; Segalés et al., 2001; Darwich et al., 2002) . Pathological stages I, II, and III defined in this work might be comparable to three distinct clinical stages of the disease (initial, intermediate and final), but some of these differences can be related to variation in immunological responses of individual pigs to PCV2 infection. Further experimental studies should be performed to better understand PMWS pathogenesis.|

Using chemical inhibitor, RNA interference and dominant negative mutant, we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection. To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection, 31 known VCP-cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments. The results showed that UFD1 (ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1), but not NPL4 (NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor), played critical roles in infections by EVA71. UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus (causing single round infection) while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays. In addition, knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein, a coreceptor of EVA71. Together, these data reveal novel roles of VCP and its cofactor UFD1 in the virus entry by EVA71. 3A-3D) . The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase https://doi.

Its chaotic solution is shown bounded in an inscribed sphere whose vertices are tangent to faces of octahedron. Based on concept of constrained optimization; Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) satisfying quadratic constraint increment multiplier matrix σ m , state observers and descriptors with estimated parameter is calculated. Moreover, an image file is decrypted by designing description for mentioned chaotic system and then encrypted on its receiver end. Furthermore, an electric circuit is designed for chaotic quadrotor using LTspice and is fitted into wireless flying robot to observe its dynamics in bounded rectangular region.	In this paper three dimensional, autonomous, nonlinear quadrotor chaotic system is considered. First of all, a state observer is derived for class of chaotic systems satisfying incremental quadratic constraints which is verified with example based on secure communication given in Section 5 . It is concluded from corollaries 3.6 and 3.7 that observer (17) we derived is generalized form of observers designed in [34, 35] . Furthermore, with the aid of LTspice, a circuit is designed for quadrotor chaotic system which we used in path tracking of robot. After performing several simulations on considered chaotic system, we concluded from Figs. 19 and 20 that second simulation show better results in bounded rectangular region. In future, our target is to design an observer for hyperchaotic systems and will try to implement on RBG images, while in robotics our aim is to implement such targets on real based models which might be helpful in worst conditions such as CoV −19 .|

43	bd3945ec343cc4535650c9425aa143f71716de7c	The clinical importance of the nomenclature, evolution and taxonomy of human papillomaviruses	"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are formally described by isolation of their circular double-stranded DNA genomes and establishment and comparison of the nucleotide sequence of these genomes. Alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of HPVs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible. Novel HPV isolates have traditionally been described as ""types"". The analysis of specific HPV types is of medical importance, because HPV types typically induce type-specific lesions, i.e. they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia, or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas. Recently, it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses. Within the papillomavirus family, closely or remotely related types form species or genera. These formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses, bacteria and higher organisms, although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited. Notably, however, HPV types that are closely related (i.e. form ""species"") are associated with similar lesions. Confusion of the terms ""type"" and ""subtype"" should be avoided, as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages. In contrast to many RNA viruses, HPV types evolve very slowly, and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2%. These divergent isolates are called ""variants"". HPVs evolved together with humankind and Homo sapiens was never without HPVs, and consequently never without warts and cervical cancer. Variants of the same HPV type may have different pathogenicity and may account for part of the worldwide disparities in the occurrence of genital cancers."	"The extensive study of papillomaviruses over the last two decades had a remarkable impact on our understanding of the etiology of HPV associated lesions. Unfortunately, it did much less to improve the clinical practice than one could have hoped for, based on the success of studying infections by other viruses, which were more amenable to vaccination and to the development of antiviral drugs (Waugh et al., 2002; Bernard, 2004) . Improvement of DNA diagnosis and recent breakthroughs in prophylactic vaccination is changing this situation (Koutsky et al., 2002) . However, as one weighs the tremendous molecular diversity against the few similarities between HPV types, it is not easy to recognize an ""Achilles heel"" of this virus group. For example, the lack of immunological cross-reaction among the capsids of the numerous high-risk HPV types may make the formulation of broad-spectrum vaccination protocols a challenge. The same lack of sequence similarity may make it difficult to target the early proteins by therapeutic vaccination and drug treatment. While sequence diversity is clearly an obstacle to combat these viruses, functions and structures that are shared across all HPV types may help to focus on shared targets, such as the unique structure of the zinc fingers of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins (Beerheide et al., 1999; Munger and Howley, 2002) and the helicase function of the E1 replication protein (Underwood et al., 2000) .|"

However, there are no rigorous estimates of total viral diversity (here termed ""virodiversity"") for any wildlife species, despite the utility of this to future surveillance and control of emerging zoonoses. In this case study, we repeatedly sampled a mammalian wildlife host known to harbor emerging zoonotic pathogens (the Indian Flying Fox, Pteropus giganteus) and used PCR with degenerate viral family-level primers to discover and analyze the occurrence patterns of 55 viruses from nine viral families. We then adapted statistical techniques used to estimate biodiversity in vertebrates and plants and estimated the total viral richness of these nine families in P. giganteus to be 58 viruses. Our analyses demonstrate proof-of-concept of a strategy for estimating viral richness and provide the first statistically supported estimate of the number of undiscovered viruses in a mammalian host. We used a simple extrapolation to estimate that there are a minimum of 320,000 mammalian viruses awaiting discovery within these nine families, assuming all species harbor a similar number of viruses, with minimal turnover between host species. We estimate the cost of discovering these viruses to be~$6.3 billion (or~$1.4 billion for 85% of the total diversity), which if annualized over a 10-year study time frame would represent a small fraction of the cost of many pandemic zoonoses. IMPORTANCE Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in viral discovery efforts. However, most lack rigorous systematic design, which limits our ability to understand viral diversity and its ecological drivers and reduces their value to public health intervention. Here, we present a new framework for the discovery of novel viruses in wildlife and use it to make the first-ever estimate of the number of viruses that exist in a mammalian host. As pathogens continue to emerge from wildlife, this estimate allows us to put preliminary bounds around the potential size of the total zoonotic pool and facilitates a better understanding of where best to allocate resources for the subsequent discovery of global viral diversity.

Different studies have called the attention to various parameters that may have influenced the spread of the virus, and in particular, the impact of climatic parameters has been emphasized. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the correlation between the average daily temperature and the rate of coronavirus epidemic growth in the infected regions. The main hypothesis object of our research is that between regions exhibiting a significant difference in the mean daily temperature, a significant difference is also observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases, and that this does not happen if there is no significant difference in mean daily temperature. To test this research hypothesis, we carried on the case study of three regions in each of five countries and analyzed the correlation through F-test, and Independent-Samples T-Test. In all five selected countries, we found that when there is a significant difference in the daily mean temperature between two regions of a country, a significant difference exists also in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases. Conversely, if there are no significant differences in the mean daily temperature of two regions in the same country, no significant difference is observed in the average cumulative daily rate of confirmed cases for these regions.	is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04. 10.20059337 doi: medRxiv preprint |

During enteric infections, proteolysis of the reovirus outer capsid protein σ3 is mediated by pancreatic serine proteases. In contrast, the proteases critical for reovirus replication in the lung are unknown. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is an acid-independent, inflammatory serine protease predominantly expressed by neutrophils. In addition to its normal role in microbial defense, aberrant expression of NE has been implicated in the pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because reovirus replication in rodent lungs causes ARDS-like symptoms and induces an infiltration of neutrophils, we investigated the capacity of NE to promote reovirus virion uncoating.	Purified Lang virions (1.4 × 10 11 ) were treated with 25 µg/ ml of NE in 40 µL of VDB at 37°C for the times indicated. Reactions were terminated as described above. To verify σ3 removal, the proteins from 5.0 × 10 10 particles were separated on SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Viral infectivity for each time point was determined by plaque assay on L929 cell monolayers.|

Adult laboratory mice are generally resistant to peripheral infection by JUNV. The mechanism underlying the mouse resistance to JUNV infection is largely unknown. We have reported that interferon receptor knockout mice succumb to JUNV infection, indicating the critical role of interferon in restricting JUNV infection in mice. Here we report that the pathogenic and vaccine strains of JUNV were highly sensitive to interferon in murine primary cells. Treatment with low concentrations of interferon abrogated viral NP protein expression in murine cells. The replication of both JUNVs was enhanced in IRF3/IRF7 deficient cells. In addition, the vaccine strain of JUNV displayed impaired growth in primary murine cells. Our data suggested a direct and potent role of host interferon response in restricting JUNV replication in mice. The defect in viral growth for vaccine JUNV might also partially explain its attenuation in mice.	Although the mouse is not the natural host for JUNV, our results with murine cells provide some insights into the basis for Candid#1 virus attenuation. Candid#1-specific mutations leading to virus attenuation in humans and guinea pigs are not established. Its ancestor XJ#44 strain, which was established by 44 passages of the human pathogenic XJ strain in mouse brain [34] , is attenuated for humans and guinea pigs but still virulent for suckling mice when introduced intracranially. The vaccine Candid#1 strain was established after additional passages of the XJ#44 strain in FRhL-2 cells. Attenuation of Candid#1 has been well characterized with a 14-day-old mouse model in a recent genetic study [35] , in which the viral GPC glycoprotein has been found as the main determinant of JUNV virulence in mice. Among a total of six amino acid changes in Candid#1 virus sequence as compared with the XJ44 strain [35, 36] , a single F427I substitution in the transmembrane region of GPC is sufficient for JUNV attenuation in suckling mice [35] . However, the mechanism of attenuation or the possible effect of accumulated mutations on virus replication in murine systems has not been established. We demonstrated the impaired growth of Candid#1 virus in primary murine cells, which was more evident at an MOI of 0.001. This defect might relate to the increased dependency of Candid#1 glycoprotein on human transferrin receptor for virus entry [36] , the compromised efficiency of Candid#1 NP and L proteins in supporting viral RNA transcription/replication [37] or other mechanisms remained to be identified in future studies. A systemic characterization of the effect of Candid#1-specific mutations on virus replication in murine systems is warranted by utilizing the JUNV reverse genetic systems. The impaired virus growth in murine cells for Candid#1 strain is biologically relevant to its attenuation, as it could at least in part explain the inability of Candid#1 virus to cause disseminated infection in mice lacking functional IFN system (our unpublished observation).|

There is an urgent need to develop antivirals that can effectively reduce dengue virus (DENV) replication and decrease viral load. Niclosamide, an antiparasitic drug approved for human use, has been recently identified as an effective antiviral agent against a number of pH-dependent viruses, including flaviviruses. Here, we reveal that neutralization of low-pH intracellular compartments by niclosamide affects multiple steps of the DENV infectious cycle. Specifically, niclosamide-induced endosomal neutralization not only prevents viral RNA replication but also affects the maturation of DENV particles, rendering them non-infectious. We found that niclosamide-induced endosomal neutralization prevented E glycoprotein conformational changes on the virion surface of flaviviruses, resulting in the release of non-infectious immature virus particles with uncleaved pr peptide from host cells. Collectively, our findings support the potential application of niclosamide as an antiviral agent against flavivirus infection and highlight a previously uncharacterized mechanism of action of the drug.

Respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, remain only about two months in any given population, although peak incidence and lethality can vary. The epidemiological data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Italy's neighbors were hit by the more dangerous ""SKII"" variant. While the epidemic in continental Asia is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the more recent epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing, albeit not exponentially anymore. The peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the U.S. first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. Containment of high-risk people, like the elderly, and reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease. Social distancing or ""lockdowns"" can be effective during the month following the peak incidence in infections, when the exponential increase of cases ends. Earlier containment of low-risk people merely prolongs the time the virus needs to circulate until the incidence is high enough to initiate ""herd immunity"". Later containment is not helpful, unless to prevent a rebound if containment started too early."	is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 |

Microglia remain quiescent, unable to perform effector and antigen presentation (APC) functions until activated by injury or infection, and have been suggested to represent the first line of defence for the CNS. Previous studies demonstrated that microglia can be persistently infected by neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes meningoencephalitis, myelitis with subsequent axonal loss, and demyelination and serve as a virus-induced model of human neurological disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Current studies revealed that MHV infection is associated with the pronounced activation of microglia during acute inflammation, as evidenced by characteristic changes in cellular morphology and increased expression of microglia-specific proteins, Iba1 (ionized calciumbinding adaptor molecule 1), which is a macrophage/microglia-specific novel calcium-binding protein and involved in membrane ruffling and phagocytosis. During chronic inflammation (day 30 postinfection), microglia were still present within areas of demyelination. Experiments performed in ex vivo spinal cord slice culture and in vitro neonatal microglial culture confirmed direct microglial infection. Our results suggest that MHV can directly infect and activate microglia during acute inflammation, which in turn during chronic inflammation stage causes phagocytosis of myelin sheath leading to chronic inflammatory demyelination.	It has been known for long time that in absence of conventional T cells microglia play a major role in neurotropic MHV-induced demyelination but the mechanism of infection and route of infection were not very clearly known for long time. Our current microglial tropism studies revealed that RSA59, an isogenic demyelinating strain of MHV, can infect and activate CNS resident microglia, and microglia can help to mediate demyelination by engulfing myelin debris. RSA59-induced neuroinflammatory models are helpful in understanding direct CNS cellular injury and demyelination that does not require an intact adaptive immune system. Understanding the role of direct CNS resident microglial infection and activation will shed some light on the pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory disease, not only infectious diseases but also chronic CNS disorders. The vision of CNSresident-microglia-driven neuroinflammatory responses in RSA59 with neuropathological consequences has extended the avenue to explore the contribution of microglia in chronic neuroinflammatory CNS diseases.|

We report that by reverse transcriptaseY polymerase chain reaction, the mRNA of LRRK2 is expressed in soluble extracts of human brain, liver, and heart and in cultured human astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendroglia as well as in human neuroblastoma cell lines. We find by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 protein (Lrrk2) specific for C-terminal residues 2511Y2527 that an apparent full-length protein and several of its fractions are expressed in soluble extracts of normal human brain. By immunocytochemistry, the antibody recognizes neurons, and more weakly astrocytes and microglia, in normal brain tissue. It intensely labels Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease and related neurodegenerative disorders. It also labels a subset of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease and the Parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam (PDCG). It labels thornshaped astrocytes and oligodendroglial coiled bodies in PDCG; oligodendroglial inclusions in multiple system atrophy; Pick bodies in Pick disease; nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions in Huntington disease; and intraneuronal and glial inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In summary, LRRK2 is constitutively expressed in neurons and also in glial cells of human brain. It strongly associates with pathological inclusions in several neurodegenerative disorders.	The fact that Lrrk2 appears to be present in neuronal and glial inclusions in several neurodegenerative disorders may indicate that a common link may exist in the pathogenesis of these disorders. It must be emphasized, however, that these are preliminary observations on a limited number of cases using a single antibody. The findings will need to be confirmed using multiple antibodies on a much larger series of cases. The finding that LRRK2 mutations were also found in a few cases with AD also reinforces this possibility. This is in harmony with previous findings showing that in familial PD cases with LRRK2 mutations, heterogenic pathologic changes were observed at autopsy. Further histologic, biochemical, and molecular analyses studies may reveal that a common thread exists, possibly in protein phosphorylations carried out by its MAPKKK domain.|

Prefusion-stabilized RSV F variants have been engineered as vaccine antigens, but crystal structures of these variants have revealed conformational differences in a key antigenic site located at the apex of the trimer, referred to as antigenic site Ø. Currently, it is unclear if flexibility in this region is an inherent property of prefusion RSV F or if it is related to inadequate stabilization of site Ø in the engineered variants. Therefore, we set out to investigate the conformational flexibility of antigenic site Ø, as well as the ability of the human immune system to recognize alternative conformations of this site, by determining crystal structures of prefusion RSV F bound to neutralizing human-derived antibodies AM22 and RSD5. Both antibodies bound with high affinity and were specific for the prefusion conformation of RSV F. Crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the antibodies recognized distinct conformations of antigenic site Ø, each diverging at a conserved proline residue located in the middle of an α-helix. These data suggest that antigenic site Ø exists as an ensemble of conformations, with individual antibodies recognizing discrete states. Collectively, these results have implications for the refolding of pneumovirus and paramyxovirus fusion proteins and should inform development of prefusion-stabilized RSV F vaccine candidates.

In addition, although the approach to grading each recommendation is outlined, the methods for literature review need to be articulated more clearly.The investigators do not provide explicit information about how the articles used in the guideline were identified and selected.This additional information would help practitioners be able to evaluate for any potential biases in the sources used for the guideline. The next step is for individual NPs to evaluate the guideline to (1) decide whether the strengths outweigh the weaknesses and (2) determine whether the guideline is applicable to their setting and clientele. Straus et al 10 recommend addressing the four ""Killer Bs"" as a way to evaluate the appropriateness of the guideline for implementation in various settings. Is the burden of illness, or the number of clients with this disease, too low to warrant use of the guideline? Are the beliefs of the clients served about the type and value of interventions or their potential consequences incompatible with the guideline? Are the opportunity costs associated with guideline implementation a bad bargain? In other words, would the resources of the practice or community be better spent elsewhere? Are the barriers (geographic, organizational, cultural, legally, etc) so high that it is not worth using the guideline? Implementation of the guideline will be Continued from page 640 Diagnosis and Management problematic in some settings (eg, those in which clients have financial barriers). If clients are being treated in the outpatient setting, inexpensive antibiotics (eg, doxycycline) can be selected; however, the need for chest radiography may be problematic. In summary, despite some weaknesses, including the acknowledged weakness that no primary care providers were involved in the development of the guideline, the CAP guideline has many strengths and in general is applicable to many NPs who work in primary care and urgent care settings. NPs are encouraged to review the guideline and determine whether it is relevant to their practice setting and clients.|"

However, the impact of exercise on the immune responses via toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, which recognizes the common viral genomic feature, singlestranded RNA, remains unclear. To clarify the effect of stressful exercise on immune function in response to viral infection, we measured the changes in the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interferon (IFN)-a, which are induced downstream from the TLR-ligand interaction, in exhaustive-exercised mice immediately after treatment with the imidazoquinoline R-848, which can bind to and activate TLR7. Both exhaustive-exercised (EX) and non-exercised (N-EX) male C3H/HeN mice were injected with R-848 (5 mg kg -1 ), and blood samples were collected. In addition, RAW264 cells, which are mouse macrophage cells, were cultured 30 min after epinephrine (10 lM) or norepinephrine (10 lM) treatments, and were then stimulated with R-848 (10 lg ml -1 ). In addition, the effect of propranolol (10 mg kg -1 ) as blockade of b-adrenergic receptors on R-848induced TNF-a and IFN-a production in the exercised mice was examined. Both the TNF-a and IFN-a concentrations in the plasma of EX were significantly lower than those in the plasma of N-EX after R-848 injection (P \ 0.05 and P \ 0.01, respectively), although the R-848 treatment increased the plasma TNF-a and IFN-a concentrations in both groups (P \ 0.01, respectively). The R-848-induced TNF-a production in RAW264 cells was significantly inhibited by epinephrine and norepinephrine pre-treatment, although IFN-a was not detected. The propranolol treatment completely inhibited exerciseinduced TNF-a and IFN-a suppression in response to R-848 in the mice. These data suggest that EX induces a reduction in TNF-a and IFN-a production in response to R-848, and that these phenomena might be regulated by an exercise-induced elevation of the systemic catecholamines.	In summary, the present study was undertaken to determine whether exhaustive exercise inhibits TNF-a and IFN-a production after R-848 injection in mice. Both TNF-a and IFN-a concentrations in exercised mice were significantly lower than those in non-exercised mice. Furthermore, in an in vitro experiment, prior epinephrine treatment strongly inhibited R-848-induced TNF-a production in macrophages. Finally, the exercise-reduced TNF-a and IFN-a production in response to R-848 is completely inhibited by the blockade of b-adrenergic receptors. These results suggest that exhaustive exercise-induced catecholamines reduce cytokine production in response to R-848 via TLR7.|
63	2129a33c39f2b2069ae830ed95b4c446746b86d2	Use of DAMPs and SAMPs as Therapeutic Targets or Therapeutics: A Note of Caution	"This opinion article discusses the increasing attention paid to the role of activating damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in initiation of inflammatory diseases and suppressing/inhibiting DAMPs (SAMPs) in resolution of inflammatory diseases and, consequently, to the future roles of these novel biomarkers as therapeutic targets and therapeutics. Since controlled production of DAMPs and SAMPs is needed to achieve full homeostatic restoration and repair from tissue injury, only their pathological, not their homeostatic, concentrations should be therapeutically tackled. Therefore, distinct caveats are proposed regarding choosing DAMPs and SAMPs for therapeutic purposes. For example, we discuss the need to a priori identify and define a context-dependent ""homeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio"" in each case and a ""homeostatic window"" of DAMP and SAMP concentrations to guarantee a safe treatment modality to patients. Finally, a few clinical examples of how DAMPs and SAMPs might be used as therapeutic targets or therapeutics in the future are discussed, including inhibition of DAMPs in hyperinflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as currently observed in Covid-19), administration of SAMPs in chronic inflammatory diseases, inhibition of SAMPs in hyperresolving processes (e.g., compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome), and administration/induction of DAMPs in vaccination procedures and anti-cancer therapy."

The total confirmed cases of Covid-19 are exponentially increasing and many countries are fighting Covid-19 with all strategies. However, there is still lacking consensus for effective strategies. Here, I demonstrate the time dependence of the doubling time in the Covid-19 exponential growths. Tracking the time-dependent doubling time tells how well Covid-19 prevention works, giving an index for successful fighting.	The Cobid-19 has been spreading rapidly in many countries since it was first discovered in December 2019 [1, 2] . The total confirmed cases of Covid-19 for 12 countries are shown in Fig. 1A , retrieved from the Johns Hopkins University [3] . Each country has more than 4,500 cases as of March 23. The initial growths of the total cases for 12 countries exhibit the exponential growth dynamics, as in Fig. 1B . In general, the exponential growth of the total cases is represented by N = N 0 exp(γt) where N 0 and N are the total cases at time t 0 and t, respectively, and γ is the growth rate. By definition, N = 2N 0 needs the doubling time (α) that is expressed as α = ln(2)/γ through ln(N/N 0 ) = ln(2) = γt. If the growth rate evolves with time, depending on the effective prevention strategies, then the doubling time changes with time. Thus, the time-dependent growth rate γ(t) causes the time-dependent doubling time α(t), defined as α(t) = t ln(2)/ ln(N/N 0 ) through γ(t) = ln(N/N 0 )/t. The doubling time for 12 countries (Fig. 1C ) was analyzed (Appendix 1). For China, the doubling time has declined until January 28 and then increased linearly since early February, due to the Wuhan containment since January 23. In South Korea, the doubling time has increased linearly without any initial decline. Since the early periods, South Korea has applied effective strategies, such as mass testing and patient tracking, to both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [4] . The steady increases in the doubling times eventually lead to the flattened total case curves for China and South Korea [2] . In other countries, the increase of the doubling time was not sufficient to flatten the total case curves. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint |

66	0015cd5eff53d9504a5e2aa47756e31579d3dbe0	An Advanced Two-Step DNN-Based Framework for Arrhythmia Detection	Heart arrhythmia is a severe heart problem. Automated heartbeat classification provides a cost-effective screening for heart arrhythmia and allows at-risk patients to receive timely treatments, which is a highly demanded but challenging task. Recent works have brought visible improvements to this area, but to identify the problematic supraventricular ectopic (S -type) heartbeats is still a bottleneck in most existing studies. This paper presents a two-step DNN-based framework to identify arrhythmia-related heartbeats. In the first step, a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) is proposed to classify all heartbeat classes, except for the normal and S -type heartbeats. In the second stage, a central-towards LSTM supportive model (CLSM) is specially designed to distinguish S -type heartbeats from the normal ones. By processing heart rhythms in central-towards directions, CLSM learns and abstracts hidden temporal information between a heartbeat and its neighbors to reveal the deep differences between the two heartbeat types. As an improvement, we also propose a rule-based data augmentation method to solve the training data imbalance problem. The proposed framework is evaluated over three real-world ECG databases. The results show that our method outperforms the baselines in most evaluation metrics.	This work presents a two-step DNN-based classification framework to identify arrhythmia-related heartbeats from ECG recordings. The framework consists of a deep dual-channel convolutional neural network (DDCNN) and a centraltowards LSTM supportive model (CLSM). In step-1, DDCNN incorporates both temporal and frequent patterns to identify V, F and Q-type heartbeats. In step-2, CLSM distinguishes S -type heartbeats from normal ones by taking advantage of the central-towards LSTMs to learn and abstract hidden temporal information of each heartbeat. The experimental results obtained on three real-world databases show that the proposed framework has the potential to make a substantial clinical impact.|
67	52530adf913973120f3b74ebf22ccb2057945500	Pandemic influenza A H1N1/09 virus infection in hematopoietic SCT recipient		Despite use of oseltamivir as the first choice for antiviral treatment of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus, data on clinical effectiveness are currently limited. Although there is no current evidence of widespread antiviral resistance among pandemic A (H1N1) influenza, a recent series with more than 1000 virus isolates tested showed 6 that have been found to be resistant to oseltamivir but sensitive to zanamivir. 5, 6 Because of the zanamivir nonoverlapping resistance pattern with oseltamivir, the former drug is being considered the best option when oseltamivir resistance is detected, although further investigation is urgently needed. Although we could not confirm the in vitro A (H1N1) resistance in our case, the clinical course clearly showed the failure of oseltamivir treatment, evidenced by clinical worsening and persistent positive nasal wash, which quickly reverted after replacement by zanamivir. Initially, only the inhalatory formulation was available and after 5 days we decided to switch to i.v. zanamivir based on a general recommendation to use the i.v. formulation for critically ill patients. 7 Steroid therapy was empirically started due to clinical worsening and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may have contributed to clinical recovery. Although benefit from such treatment remains controversial in the literature, steroid therapy has been used in many case series and there is a possible benefit of low to moderate dose of corticosteroid in ARDS associated with H1N1 virus infection. 8, 9 Clinicians caring for severely immunosuppressed patients with the recently identified influenza A (H1N1) virus infection should be aware of prolonged viral shedding and the potential for antiviral drug resistance development during therapy.|
68	0a9a85b82e17c880c923b5de9bec22931ed76f13	A line immunoassay utilizing recombinant nucleocapsid proteins for detection of antibodies to human coronaviruses	Most coronaviruses infecting humans cause mild diseases, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus is an extremely dangerous pathogen. Here, we report the development of a serologic assay for detection of antibodies to human coronaviruses (HCoVs) based on recombinant nucleocapsid (N) proteins of all known pathogenic strains (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS). The novel immunoassay is highly useful for epidemiologic surveys, where use of nucleic acid diagnostics often is limited. Purified recombinant antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes and applied in a line immunoassay, which allows rapid detection of antibodies to 5 different HCoVs in a single experiment. For assay evaluation, serum samples from persons infected with 229E or OC43 (acute/convalescent), recovered SARS patients and healthy donors were analyzed. Screening for nucleocapsid (N)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in convalescent sera reached 100% sensitivity. With this new technique, we found that recently identified NL63 and HKU1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infections. Possibly, cross-reactive antibody responses were observed using 229E and OC43 serum pairs. However, the potential of this assay could clearly be demonstrated employing SARS-positive serum samples, where nonspecific binding to nucleocapsids of other HCoVs was not observed. This coronavirus strain-specific line immunoassay represents a powerful tool for serologic diagnostics.	In conclusion, we consider our line immunoassay approach to be highly favorable for large-scale epidemiologic studies on coronaviruses. Our assay system allows rapid and easy detection of antibodies against all known HCoVs in a single experiment with 1 antigen-coated strip, requiring only very low serum volumes (15 μL). By replacing secondary anti-human IgG with anti-human IgM, the immunoassay could easily be adjusted to screen for human IgM, which might flank RT-PCR-based diagnosis of acute HCoV infections in clinical settings. In this context, it would be advisable to test sequential (acute and convalescent) serum samples to track seroconversion and to define the immunoassay's role in the diagnosis of acute infections. Assay setup and test strip production are straightforward and cost-effective. N proteins are appropriate antigens because they are extremely immunogenic and provide a sensitive and reliable tool for antibody detection. Yet, beyond acute infections, our data also indicate that cross-reactive epitopes among HCoVs within group I or group II might be involved in IgG response to HCoV nucleocapsids. In addition, the line immunoassay may detect all remote infections experienced in the past. To gain even better specificity and to exclude possible false-positive results, it would be beneficial to extend the antigen portfolio on the strips. Therefore, future experiments will aim at additional studies focusing on potential cross-reactivities and fine-tuning of our assay by inclusion of other antigens or specific immunoreactive peptides in addition to full-length N proteins.|

The lungs were dislodged from the thoracic cavity and placed in a glass vial containing approximately 50 mL of fixative. Each glass vial was assigned a number unknown (with respect to treatment) to the pathologists. The lungs were fixed for at least 48 h before further processing. The formalin-fixed mouse lungs were embedded in paraffin, thin-sectioned coronally, and mounted onto glass microscope slides using standard histopathological techniques. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. For each group, six mice were euthanized, and the mouse lung tissues were examined under the 200× and 400× objectives. For each mouse, a slide containing one lung section was examined independently by three pathologists blinded to the treatment or genotype.

In thermal dissociation experiments with cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and probed by small-angle neutron scattering, we observed a slight shrinkage of viral capsids, which can be related to the strengthening of the hydrophobic interaction between subunits at increasing temperature. By considering the temperature dependence of hydrophobic interaction in the homogeneous lattice model, we were able to give a better estimate of the effective charge. In the heterogeneous lattice model, two sets of lattice sites represented different capsid subunits with asymmetric interaction strengths. In that case, the dissociation of capsids was found to shift from a sharp one-step transition to a gradual two-step transition by weakening the hydrophobic interaction between AB and CC subunits. We anticipate that such lattice models will shed further light on the statistical mechanics underlying virus assembly and disassembly.	In a heterogeneous lattice model, where two components were introduced to account for the asymmetric interaction between capsid subunits, we found a gradual and smooth dissociation process of empty capsids upon the increase of temperature. When the hydrophobic interaction between AB and CC subunits was much weaker than that between AB subunits, the capsid dissociated through a two-step process, in which CC subunits dissociated first at lower temperature than AB subunits. By contrast, the capsid dissociated in a sharp one-step process when the hydrophobic interactions were all comparable, and both kinds of subunits dissociated simultaneously.|

In contrast to microglia, oligodendroglia are resistant to CD8 T cell perforin-mediated viral control in the absence of IFNg. Kinetic induction of MHC Class I expression by microglia and oligodendroglia in vivo was thus analyzed to assess responses to distinct inflammatory signals. Flow cytometry demonstrated delayed Class I surface expression by oligodendroglia compared with microglia. Distinct kinetics of Class I protein upregulation correlated with cell type specific transcription patterns of genes encoding Class I heavy chains and antigen processing components. Microglia isolated from na€ ıve mice expressed high levels of these mRNAs, whereas they were near detection limits in oligodendroglia; nevertheless, Class I protein was undetectable on both cell types. Infection induced modest mRNA increases in microglia, but dramatic transcriptional upregulation in oligodendroglia coincident with IFNa or IFNg mRNA increases in infected tissue. Ultimately mRNAs reached similar levels in both cell types at their respective time points of maximal Class I expression. Expression of Class I on microglia, but not oligodendroglia, in infected IFNg deficient mice supported distinct IFN requirements for Class I presentation. These data suggest an innate immune preparedness of microglia to present antigen and engage CD8 T cells early following infection. The delayed, yet robust, IFNg dependent capacity of oligodendroglia to express Class I suggests strict control of immune interactions to avoid CD8 T cell recognition and potential presentation of autoantigen to preserve myelin maintenance. V V C	Overall the stringent induction of MHC genes by oligodendroglia implies a tendency to avoid CD8 T cell cytolysis and preserve myelin maintenance and neuronal function. Nevertheless, as oligodendroglia are myelin factories, it is feasible to assume they present myelin derived epitopes during inflammation associated with IFNg secretion. Indeed, MBP specific CD8 T cells can recognize and lyse oligodendroglia in the absence of exogenous peptide in vitro (Huseby et al., 2001) . Similarly, CD8 T cell inflammation induced by overexpression of PLP by oligodendroglia is associated with Class I expression on oligodendroglia and CNS damage (Ip et al., 2006) . Activation and clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in brain biopsy samples and CSF of multiple sclerosis patients supports a role of local CNS autoantigen presentation (Babbe et al., 2000; Jacobsen et al., 2002; Skulina et al., 2004) . Furthermore, although Class I and IRF-1 was prominently expressed by activated microglia/macrophages in multiple sclerosis lesions, both proteins were also localized to oligodendroglia (Gobin et al., 2001) . However, in vivo interactions between CD8 T cells and Class I peptide complexes presented by oligodendroglia have not been formally proven. The potent transcriptional upregulation of Class I antigen presentation components by oligodendroglia presented in this report clearly demonstrates a potential for oligodendroglia to present myelin antigens. However, the exquisite sensitivity of microglia to early inflammatory cytokines implicates these cells as targets for initial CD8 T-cell interactions.|

A portable, miniaturized POC NAAT with performance comparable to conventional PCR (polymerase-chain reaction)-based tests in clinical laboratories can be realized with a disposable, palm-sized, plastic microfluidic chip in which: (1) nucleic acids (NAs) are extracted from relatively large (~mL) volume sample lysates using an embedded porous silica glass fiber or cellulose binding phase (""membrane"") to capture sample NAs in a flow-through, filtration mode; (2) NAs captured on the membrane are isothermally (~65 °C) amplified; (3) amplicon production is monitored by real-time fluorescence detection, such as with a smartphone CCD camera serving as a low-cost detector; and (4) paraffin-encapsulated, lyophilized reagents for temperature-activated release are pre-stored in the chip. Limits of Detection (LOD) better than 10 3 virons/sample can be achieved.

Extensions to a myriad of related applications including, for example, food OPEN ACCESS Microarrays 2015, 4 475 testing, cancer screening, and insect genotyping are briefly surveyed."	The various modules described herein can be combined into total microanalytical systems for sample-to-report POC diagnostics devices. In this review, we focused on NAAT of HIV in blood, suggesting the application of similar designs for other nucleic acid based tests where time, convenience, cost constraints would preclude the use of a microarrays, while still achieving multiplexing capability and quantification of both RNA and DNA targets with only modest or no instrumentation. We use a solid-phase extraction for NA isolation based on the common chaotrope-silica method used in commercial spin columns. Related NA isolation methods based on ChargeSwitch ® Technology (CST) and solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) are also potential alternatives. These point-of care molecular diagnostics devices complement microarrays and provide an alternative to expensive laboratory-based instruments. As a comparison, commercial PCR-based and related systems, such as the COBAS AmpliPrep/Taqman HIV-1 (Roche), VERSANT HIV-1 RNA (Siemens), RNA QT (bioMerieux), and RealTime m2000 HIV (Abbott) can process close to 100 samples in a two-hour time span. Limits of detection typically range from 50 to 100 copies/mL plasma [46] . These instruments cost over $100,000 and their use is restricted to modern clinical laboratory facilities.|

It inhibits the replication of many viruses and ultimately promotes apoptosis of infected cells, contributing to the control of virus spread. However, viruses have evolved a range of escape strategies that act against different steps in the pathway. Here we unraveled a novel escape strategy involving Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) L* protein. Previously we found that L* was the first viral protein binding directly RNase L. Our current data show that L* binds the ankyrin repeats R1 and R2 of RNase L and inhibits 2'-5' oligoadenylates (2-5A) binding to RNase L. Thereby, L* prevents dimerization and oligomerization of RNase L in response to 2-5A. Using chimeric mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) expressing TMEV L*, we showed that L* efficiently inhibits RNase L in vivo. Interestingly, those data show that L* can functionally substitute for the MHV-encoded phosphodiesterase ns2, which acts upstream of L* in the OAS/RNase L pathway, by degrading 2-5A.	Statistics were done using the tests indicated in the figure legends using GraphPad Prism. Error bars represent standard error of the means.

Whilst in the USA the vaccine market is quite large, approximately $25 million, it is very much smaller in Canada ($2 million) and in Europe. For example the total UK market is estimated at £2.4 million and that includes lungworm vaccine. Therefore there may not be great commercial incentive for some pharmaceutical companies to develop such products. Of course it might be argued that the market is related to vaccine efficacy. Therefore if good vaccines are produced then the potential market will be much greater.|

Pharmacological studies have already proved JYH ideal clinical therapeutic effects on inflammation and infectious diseases and prominent effects on multiple targets in vitro and in vivo, such as pro-inflammatory protein inducible nitric oxide synthase, toll-like receptor 4, interleukin-1 receptor. JYH and Lonicerae flos [called Shanyinhua, SYH in Chinese, flowers or flower buds of Lonicera hypoglauca Miquel, Lonicera confusa De Candolle or Lonicera macrantha (D.Don) Spreng] which belongs to the same family of JYH were once recorded as same herb in multiple versions of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP). However, they were listed as two different herbs in 2005 Edition ChP, leading to endless controversy since they have close proximity on plant species, appearances and functions, together with traditional applications. In the past decades, there has no literature regarding to systematical comparison on the similarity concerning research achievements of the two herbs. This review comprehensively presents similarities and differences between JYH and SYH retrospectively, particularly proposing them the marked differences in botanies, phytochemistry and pharmacological activities which can be used as evidence of separate list of JYH and SYH. Furthermore, deficiencies on present studies have also been discussed so as to further research could use for reference.	In conclusion, it is necessary to accelerate the phytochemistry and pharmacological studies of SYH, and figure out its difference and similarity with JYH more in-depth. Future direction of research should pay attention to accurate and rapid authentication of JYH and SYH for it is crucial to ensure the safety and function of medicinal or edible herbs as well as their preparations. Additionally, more efforts deserve to gain insights into the toxicological actions of JYH and SYH.|

As part of an effort to generate broad-spectrum inhibitors of these enzymes, we screened a library of inhibitors based on a halopyridinyl ester from a previous study of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 3CL proteinase against Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3C pro . Three of the compounds, which also had furan rings, inhibited the cleavage activity of HAV 3C pro with K ic s of 120-240 nM. HPLC-based assays revealed that the inhibitors were slowly hydrolyzed by both HAV 3C pro and SARS 3CL pro , confirming the identity of the expected products. Mass spectrometric analyses indicated that this hydrolysis proceeded via an acylenzyme intermediate. Modeling studies indicated that the halopyridinyl moiety of the inhibitor fits tightly into the S1-binding pocket, consistent with the lack of tolerance of the inhibitors to modification in this portion of the molecule. These compounds are among the most potent non-peptidic inhibitors reported to date against a 3C pro .	Automated molecular docking was performed using the program AutoDock 3.0.5 and a recent structural model of HAV 3C pro (PDB: 2CXV) 4 as the target. The 3D structures of ester compounds were constructed using Sybyl 7.1 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, USA). Inhibitor-enzyme interactions were evaluated using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA). Binding energies between the compounds and the protein were evaluated using a grid map with 60 · 60 · 60 points spaced at 0.375 Å generated using the AUTOGRID program. Default values of the docking parameters were used except for the following: step sizes for translation (0.2 Å ), orientation (5°), and torsion (5°); and the number of generations (37,000); energy evaluations (1,500,000), and docking runs (20) . The docked inhibitor-enzyme complexes were ranked according to the lowest predicted binding energies and the conformity to ideal geometry of the docked structures.|

Access is limited by a range of factors including inability to pay, a lack of infrastructure, and corruption in some countries. Surrounding and exacerbating these structural and technological problems is the layer of legal rights created by patents and their licensing that complicate and render more expensive the preparation and delivery of needed medicines, particularly those that need to be adapted to the social, health and cultural environment of developing countries. This article provides a survey of innovative strategies that aim at maximizing the potential of patents to facilitate the development and delivery of medicines against diseases, the burden of which falls principally on developing country populations. To understand the context in which these strategies are being proposed and implemented, the article reviews the battles over access to medicines beginning in the late 1980s. It then surveys some of the principal suggestions put forward to better direct innovation systems in addressing the critical health needs of the world's majority including advance market commitments, patent buy-outs, prize funds, public-private partnerships and patent pools.	Without increased trust, even mechanisms proven in other fields, such as patent pools, will gain little traction. Trust requires, among other things, visionary leadership by the highest levels of management within industry and NGOs (Tait et al., 2007) , greater levels of interaction on small projects with clear outcomes, and more transparent negotiation processes. Time will tell whether actors are ready for such leadership.|

There have also been pediatric cases that were asymptomatic but subsequent serological screening confirmed the diagnosis of coronavirus infection. Only a small percentage of adolescent patients may have a slightly more severe course with progressive deterioration in the first week or two.13-15 There has not been any fatality among more than 100 pediatric cases of SARS in Hong Kong. Although we have treated the more severe adolescent cases with ribavirin, there is increasing evidence that this drug is ineffective against the SARS coronavirus. The use of steroid is even more controversial and we would not recommend this form of treatment until the efficacy and safety are proven in clinical trials. On the contrary, quantitative RT-PCR studies in our children revealed that the numbers of RNA viral copies showed no relationship with steroid or ribavirin treatment.12 CONCLUSION In just 6 months, SARS has infected more than 8000 people and claimed almost 800 lives worldwide Further studies are needed to reveal the reasons why children have a much milder disease than adults. Strict infection control is of paramount importance in preventing nosocomial infection among healthcare workers. The natural reservoir for this new virus is still unknown although preliminary evidence suggested than it originates from wild animals. Intensive research is currently underway in the development of a rapid and reliable point-of-care diagnostic test. Until a rapid and reliable diagnostic test is widely, a history of contact with adult SARS cases remains as the most important clue for paediatricians to make an early diagnosis of this infection in children. The optimal treatment for SARS in children remains to be determined.|

Human Rhinoviruses are the prevalent causative agents, but other viruses are also implicated. Being so common, viral colds, have significant implications on public health and quality of life, but may also be life-threatening for vulnerable groups of patients. Specific diagnosis and treatment of the common cold still remain unmet needs. Molecular diagnostic techniques allow specific detection of known pathogens as well as the identification of newly emerging viruses. Although a number of medications or natural treatments have been shown to have some effect, either on the number or on the severity of common colds, no single agent is considerably effective. Virus-specific management remains in most cases a challenging potential as many factors have to be taken into account, including the diversity of the viral genomes, the heterogeneity of affected individuals, as well as the complexity of this long standing host-virus relationship.

However, the number of EM diagnostic laboratories has decreased considerably and an increasing number of people encounter difficulties with EM results. Therefore, the research on viral structure and morphology has become important in EM diagnostic practice. EM has several technological advantages, and should be a fundamental tool in clinical diagnosis of viruses, particularly when agents are unknown or unsuspected. In this article, we review the historical contribution of EM to virology, and its use in virus differentiation, localization of specific virus antigens, virus-cell interaction, and viral morphogenesis. It is essential that EM investigations are based on clinical and comprehensive pathogenesis data from light or confocal microscopy. Furthermore, avoidance of artifacts or false results is necessary to exploit fully the advantages while minimizing its limitations. electron microscopy, viral structure, viral morphology, viral diagnosis Citation:	EM is a fundamental tool in clinical virus diagnosis and research into basic viral mechanisms, particularly in cases where agents are unknown or unsuspected. EM is used for etiological identification in outbreaks with emerging viruses, analysis of morphology and morphogenesis of viral pathogens, and ultrastructural comparisons for anti-viral drug design [101] in gene therapy. It is essential that EM is based on clinical data and comprehensive pathogenesis data from routine histology. Combined use of EM, IEM and cryo-EM [48, 49] is recommended to exploit fully the advantages of this technique while minimizing its limitations, although cryo-EM is not a suitable tool for pathogen detection. |
97	81b884033a6b887666694f769e5b1dd92f7e8e75	Christian Schou	Systems biology depends on a comprehensive assignment and characterization of the interactions of proteins and polypeptides (functional proteomics) and of other classes of biomolecules in a given organism. High-capacity screening methods are in place for ligand capture and interaction screening, but a detailed dynamic characterization of molecular interactions under physiological conditions in efficiently separated mixtures with minimal sample consumption is presently provided only by electrophoretic interaction analysis in capillaries, affinity CE (ACE). This has been realized in different fields of biology and analytical chemistry, and the resulting advances and uses of ACE during the last 2.5 years are covered in this review. Dealing with anything from small divalent metal ions to large supramolecular assemblies, the applications of ACE span from lowaffinity binding of broad specificity being exploited in optimizing selectivity, e.g., in enantiomer analysis to miniaturized affinity technologies, e.g., for fast processing immunoassay. Also, approaches that provide detailed quantitative characterization of analyte-ligand interaction for drug, immunoassay, and aptamer development are increasingly important, but various approaches to ACE are more and more generally applied in biological research. In addition, the present overview emphasizes that distinct challenges regarding sensitivity, parallel processing, information-rich detection, interfacing with MS, analyte recovery, and preparative capabilities remain. This will be addressed by future technological improvements that will ensure continuing new applications of ACE in the years to come.	While the applicability of ACE is still challenged by technical limitations, it is now used quite broadly in analytical chemistry and the biological sciences as is apparent from above. The limitations chiefly concern analyte recovery, peak identification, limits in parallel processing, and in understanding the interplay between binding rates and separation parameters. Perhaps the most limiting factor for using the technique outside specialist laboratories is the fact that ACE is not one, but a suite of different techniques united by a capillary electrophoretic separation step. Therefore, its particular embodiment in specific applications depends on the questions and interacting systems to be examined. This is amply illustrated by the numerous modes of ACE used in the publications cited in this review. Despite the obstacles to being a universal systems biology tool, affinity interactions and CE will be increasingly integrated in many functional biology studies. CE will also find continued use as an analytical and preparative tool during development of specific binding reagents including immunoreagents such as mAbs, in vitro affinity-maturated single-chain Fv-fragments, and phage displayed variable regions as well as aptamers and chemical libraries. Also the functional and structural assessment of drugs and novel drug candidates will entail a growing use of ACE. Additionally, the specific area of protein conformational studies, which is important for, e.g., biological drug development and for the understanding of disease, will continue to benefit from CE which is complementary to NMR-and MS-based methods in this field. Finally, technical innovations will continue in the areas outlined above, and to the extent that these are simple and easily accessible, the usefulness of combining affinity interactions with CE analyses will be increasingly obvious.|

We studied the follow-up changes of circulating vasoactive peptides and cytokines until the improvement or the worsening of a patient and progression into specific organ dysfunctions. In a prospective study, concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFNγ), endocan and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) were measured in serum by an enzyme immunoassay in 175 patients at baseline; this was repeated within 24 h upon progression into new organ dysfunction (n = 141) or improvement (n = 34). Endocan and Ang-2 were the only parameters that were significantly increased among patients who worsened. Any increase of endocan was associated with worsening with odds ratio 16.65 (p < 0.0001). This increase was independently associated with progression into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as shown after logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 2.91, p: 0.002). Changes of circulating cytokines do not mediate worsening of the critically ill patients. Instead endocan and Ang2 are increased and this may be interpreted as a key-playing role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and septic shock. Any increase of endocan is a surrogate of worsening of the clinical course.	Informed consent A patient was enrolled after written informed consent provided by his first-degree relatives. |

"J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f affects both women and men, men appear to have disproportionately higher rates of mortality (1, 2) . SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into cells. Limited human data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing ACE/ACE2 balance toward a state of heightened angiotensin II production, leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction, inflammation, and oxidative-related organ damage to increase risk for acute lung injury. However, as ACE2 is an ""X"" linked enzyme and some reports indicate an increase in plasma ACE2 in older women, they would appear to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Yet, reports from China, Italy, and New York clearly document that women have about half of the COVID-19 incidence with much less disease severity and mortality compared with men. Perhaps higher ACE2 produces more Ang-1-7, which provides more protection? It may also be possible that higher ACE2 activity provides a more efficient ""sink"" in eliminating the virus or preventing its attachment for target cell entry. Differential regulation of ACE2 with sex hormones may be working, as well. Investigation of this disparity could provide important clues to better understanding complexities of this enzyme and improving COVID-19 outcomes.|"

In India, malarial infection is on rise due to rapid urbanization and overcrowding in all major metropolitan cities. The incidence of morbidity and mortality due to malaria infection is increasing and could be attributed to drug resistance in strains of malarial parasite. Combining immune modulation strategies with anti-malarial drugs has a beneficial effect in an attempt to improve treatment for malaria. Along with clinical presentation and outcome of this parasitic infection, it is important to understand immunological disturbances associated with biological mechanisms underlying these actions in better understanding of pathogenesis of malarial infection. Immune and inflammatory responses in malarial infection are controlled and co-ordinated by various cytokines and chemokines. This review focuses on commonly seen immunological disturbances associated with malarial infection resulting in related humoral and cell mediated immune functions primarily with innate to subsequent adaptive immunity in tackling this parasitic infection.

Our goal was to evaluate the outcome of patients with severe CAP, focusing on the impact of new rather than old fluoroquinolones combined with β-lactam in the empirical antimicrobial treatments. Methods: Retrospective study of consecutive patients admitted in a 16-bed general intensive care unit (ICU), (Pneumonia Severity Index > or = 4) community-acquired pneumonia due to non penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and treated with a β-lactam combined with a fluoroquinolone. Results: We included 70 patients of whom 38 received a β-lactam combined with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin and 32 combined with levofloxacin. Twenty six patients (37.1%) died in the ICU. Three independent factors associated with decreased survival in ICU were identified: septic shock on ICU admission (AOR = 10.6; 95% CI 2.87-39.3; p = 0.0004), age > 70 yrs. (AOR = 4.88; 95% CI 1.41-16.9; p = 0.01) and initial treatment with a β-lactam combined with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin (AOR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.13-15.13; p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our results suggest that, when combined to a β-lactam, levofloxacin is associated with lower mortality than ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin in severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia.

We estimated the speed with which these measures contained community transmission in each of 58 Chinese cities. On average, containment was achieved 7.83 days (SD 6.79 days) after the implementation of social distancing interventions, with an average reduction in the reproduction number ( R t ) of 54.3% (SD 17.6%) over that time period. A single day delay in the implementation of social distancing led to a 2.41 (95% CI: 0.97, 3.86) day delay in containment. Swift social distancing interventions may thus achieve rapid containment of newly emerging COVID-19 outbreaks.

Viral interference is a phenomenon in which a cell infected by a virus does not allow multiplication of a second virus [51] . Viral interference can be explained by different mechanisms including competing by attachment interference, therefore, reducing or blocking of receptor sites for the super-infecting virus; competing intracellularly for replication host machinery; and virus-induced interferon interference [52] .

First, DNA was amplified by a novel asymmetric multiplex PCR with universal primer(s). Second, the 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled PCR products were hybridized specifically with oligonucleotide microarrays. Finally, matched duplexes were detected by using a laser-induced fluorescence scanner. The usefulness of this method was illustrated by analyzing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus RNA. The detection limit was 10 0 copies/μL. The results of the asymmetric multiplex nested reverse transcription-PCR were in agreement with the results of the microarray hybridization; no hybridization signal was lost as happened with applicons from symmetric amplifications. This reliable method can be used to the identification of other microorganisms, screening of genetic diseases, and other applications.	Occasionally, even if all these factors are considered, the result may not be the same as predicted owing to the unforeseen interactions of primers. The problem could be solved by changing one of the gene-specific primers. 8. A fluorescence molecule, TAMRA, was labeled to the 5′ end of the universal primers in our study. The hybridization results are in agreement with the asymmetric multiplex PCR results ( Table 3 and Fig. 4) , so we consider the labeling is adequate for scanning. However, there is a hidden trouble. Some DNA strands produced by the gene-specific primers should also be able to hybridize with the corresponding probes printed on the microarrays, but no fluorescence signal is detectable under these circumstances. To increase the hybridization signal, the gene-specific primers may also be end-labeled. 9. SARS is a serious respiratory illness with significant morbidity and mortality rate (31-37). Its diagnosis depends mainly on the clinical findings of an atypical pneumonia not attributed to any other cause and a history of exposure to a suspect or probable case of SARS, or to the respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids of individuals with SARS. Definitive diagnosis of this novel CoV relies on classic tissue culture isolation, followed by electron microscopy studies to identify the virus in cell culture, which is technically very demanding. Serological testing for increasing titer against SARS-associated CoV was shown to be highly sensitive and specific (32) but was not suitable for quick and early laboratory diagnosis. Molecular tests have also been attempted for the detection of this virus or to confirm infection (48,49) . However, only one target was detected in one test using the existing methods, so a higher risk of false negatives was inevitably encountered. Our method is quite different from the existing methods: asymmetric multiplex nested RT-PCR amplification followed by microarray hybridization. The assay was sufficiently sensitive that 10 0 copies/μL viral RNA could be detected. We have used this method to realize the early sensitive detection of SARS virus from clinic samples (unpublished work). In actual application, the universal primer uf was omitted. In other words, the ratio of 0:1 for universal primer uf to ur was adopted for efficiency and convenience. 10 . In summary, we have established a sensitive and versatile asymmetric multiplex PCR method. Combining with the microarray assay, this method may be applicable in a number of fields, such as identification of microorganisms, detection of the drug-resistant genes, and diagnosis of genetic diseases.|

Interleukin (IL)-12 is a heterodimeric proinflammatory cytokine formed by a p35 and a p40 subunit that can induce differentiation of naïve T cells towards a T helper 1-response. To determine the role of IL-12 in respiratory tract infection with influenza, p35 gene deficient (p35 −/− ) and normal wild type mice were intranasally infected with influenza A virus. IL-12 p35 −/− mice displayed a transiently enhanced rather than an impaired viral clearance, as indicated by a 10-fold reduction in viral loads on day 8 after infection. Although interferon-␥ levels were significantly lower in the lungs of IL-12 p35 −/− mice, their cellular immune responses were not altered, as reflected by similar T cell CD69 expression and influenza-specific T cell recruitment. Our data indicate that endogenous IL-12 impairs viral clearance during the late phase of influenza A virus infection in mice.	In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the host response to influenza A is modestly altered during the late phase of viral infection in IL-12 p35 −/− mice, animals that are totally and selectively deficient for IL-12. This finding contrasts with numerous reports on strongly enhanced susceptibility of IL-12 deficient mice to infections by a variety of other pathogens, in particular mycobacteria and parasites (Romani et al., 1997) . Our data strongly suggest that endogenous IL-12 is not important for protective immunity against respiratory tract infection with influenza A.|

The cautious infection containment approach presented includes 1) designated hospital units with secured ventilation systems; 2) restricted institutional access for patients, family members, and HCWs with prolonged patient exposure; 3) identification of primary and backup teams, including infection control personnel, infectious disease, and pulmonary and critical care physicians and nurses; and 4) continuation of infection control measures until the results of specific SARS coronavirus diagnostic tests become available. These measures may serve as an outline for preventing the potentially devastating nosocomial spread of SARS in centers that provide care for high-risk patients.|

One key task in data integration is the calculation of similarities between records to identify pairs or sets of records that correspond to the same real-world entities. Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, the owners of sensitive databases are often not allowed or willing to exchange or share their data with other organisations to allow such similarity calculations. In this paper we propose a novel privacy-preserving encoding technique that can be used to securely calculate similarities between sensitive values held in different databases. Our technique uses two-step hashing to encode values into an integer set representation that provides strong privacy guarantees and allows accurate similarity calculations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy and privacy of our encoding technique, and conduct an empirical study on large real databases containing several millions records. Our results show that our technique provides high security against privacy attacks and achieves better similarity accuracy compared to two state-of-the-art encoding techniques.	We have presented a novel encoding approach that can be used for privacypreserving record linkage (PPRL). We used a two-step hashing process to encode sensitive values into integer sets. Our analysis showed that our encoding can provide high linkage quality, validated on large real databases, where it can achieve higher quality similarity calculations compared to other encoding techniques used in PPRL. Our approach also provides privacy against frequency attacks on integer sets which prevents the re-identification of encoded sensitive values. As future work we aim to extend the experiments with different hashing techniques in our encoding approach. Another future research avenue is to find the optimal values for the length of bit vectors and the number of hash function used in the encoding process that can maximise both linkage quality and privacy. Furthermore, we plan to adapt existing privacy attacks for our encoding and conduct a privacy comparison with other PPRL techniques.|

Here we estimate the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 and propose a dynamical model for the time course of infection number. With this model, we assessed the effects of different measures for infection risk control. The model is different from the previous ones as it models the population as heterogeneous, with subpopulations having different infection risks. Our analyses showed that after this heterogeneity is incorporated in the model, several characteristics of the epidemic are estimated more accurately: the total number of cases and peak number of cases are lower compared to the homogeneous case, the early-stage growth rate in the number of infection cases is little affected, and the decrease in the number of infections slows down during the epidemic late stage. The comparison of our model results with the available data for COVID-19 indicates that the anti-epidemic measures undertaken in China and the rest of the world managed to decrease the basic reproductive number but did not assure an accumulation of sufficient collective immunity. Thus, the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart, which necessitates a careful approach to lifting the quarantine measures.

Two closely related innate immunity genes, CD209 and CD209L, are particularly interesting because they directly recognize a plethora of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Both genes, which result from an ancient duplication, possess a neck region, made up of seven repeats of 23 amino acids each, known to play a major role in the pathogenbinding properties of these proteins. To explore the extent to which pathogens have exerted selective pressures on these innate immunity genes, we resequenced them in a group of samples from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia. Moreover, variation in the number of repeats of the neck region was defined in the entire Human Genome Diversity Panel for both genes. Our results, which are based on diversity levels, neutrality tests, population genetic distances, and neck-region length variation, provide genetic evidence that CD209 has been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of any amino acid changes, whereas CD209L variability has most likely been shaped by the action of balancing selection in non-African populations. In addition, our data point to the neck region as the functional target of such selective pressures: CD209 presents a constant size in the neck region populationwide, whereas CD209L presents an excess of length variation, particularly in non-African populations. An additional interesting observation came from the coalescent-based CD209 gene tree, whose binary topology and time depth (∼2.8 million years ago) are compatible with an ancestral population structure in Africa. Altogether, our study has revealed that even a short segment of the human genome can uncover an extraordinarily complex evolutionary history, including different pathogen pressures on host genes as well as traces of admixture among archaic hominid populations.	More generally, our study has revealed that even a short segment of the human genome can help uncover an extraordinarily complex evolutionary history, including different pathogen pressures on host immunity genes, as well as traces of ancient population structure in the African continent. The coming years will certainly bring unprecedented large data sets of sequence diversity, genomewide and populationwide, with each genomic region possibly revealing a different aspect of human history. The integration of all these apparently independent pieces of the same reality will provide us with a much broader and more realistic view of the demographic history of the human species, as well as of human adaptation to the different environmental conditions imposed not only by pathogens but also by other major factors such as climate and nutritional resources.|

To control spread and finally contain novel viruses, rapid identification and subsequent isolation of infected individuals and their contacts is of utmost importance. Next to methods for nucleic acid detection, validated serological assays are particularly important as the timeframe for antibody detection is less restricted. During the SARS-CoV epidemic a wide variety of serological diagnostic assays were established using multiple methods as well as different viral antigens. Even though the majority of the developed assays showed high sensitivity and specificity, numerous studies reported on cross-reactive antibodies to antigens from wide-spread common cold associated CoVs. In order to improve preparedness and responsiveness during future outbreaks of novel CoVs, information and problems regarding serological diagnosis that occurred during the SARS-CoV should be acknowledged.	To improve and coordinate the development of serological assays during future outbreaks of novel coronaviruses, a wellcharacterized subset of sera would be highly recommendable in order to implement a standardized protocol for validating new assays.|

Primed T cells are mostly manifested by elevated level of CD25 expression while their effector/memory offspring include MHC-II + positive subsets, namely CD4 + CD8a + ab T cell and CD2 + CD8a + gd T cells [10, 14, 33, 43] . At the B cells level, priming results in loss of CD2 expression [32, 34] . The resultant CD2 À CD21 + B cells without further stimulation rapidly re-express CD2 on their surface but once stimulated, they proliferate and mature into CD21 À B cell compartment. CD21 À B cells, either CD2 + or CD2 À are able to generate proliferating uHC À plasmablast or non-proliferating uHC À plasma cells that are terminal stages of B cell maturation [34, 65] . Also remarkable is the divergence of the pattern antibody repertoire in that $80% of all V H genes in conventional pigs are no longer identifiable as one of the seven V H genes that comprise >95% of the pre-immune repertoire because they have undergone somatic hyper-mutations [28] .|

In this paper, a plastic-based microfluidic immunosensor chip for the diagnosis of swine flu (H1N1) was developed by immobilizing hemagglutinin antigen on a gold surface using a genetically engineered polypeptide. A fluorescent dye-labeled antibody (Ab) was used for quantifying the concentration of Ab in the immunosensor chip using a fluorescent technique. For increasing the detection efficiency and reducing the errors, three chambers and three microchannels were designed in one microfluidic chip. This protocol could be applied to the diagnosis of other infectious diseases in a microfluidic device.	In this study, we report a development of a microfluidic device for the detection of human influenza by antigen-antibody interaction based on a highly transparent and inexpensive polymer. The significant fluorescence intensity changes over the different concentrations to the serological antibodies and three different chambers in one microchannel provide more accurate information to detect the H1N1 flu virus. In addition, the immunosensor chips were successfully applied for the detection of the H1N1 without any surface modification of microfluidic chip. The proposed integrated plastic-based microfluidic chip could provide a significant improvement in the miniaturization and a cost-effective way for bio-analysis systems. Therefore, this platform offers perspective for point-of-care testing diagnosis in various infectious disease areas.|

The substrate recognition mechanism has been fully elucidated for mammalian DPP IV by crystal structure analyses but not for bacterial orthologues. Here, we report the crystal structures of a bacterial DPP IV (PmDAP IV) in its free form and in complexes with two kinds of dipeptides as well as with a non-peptidyl inhibitor at 1.90 to 2.47 Å resolution. Acyl-enzyme intermediates were observed for the dipeptide complexes of PmDAP IV, whereas tetrahedral intermediates were reported for the oligopeptide complexes of mammalian DPP IVs. This variation reflects the different structural environments of the active site Arg residues, which are involved in the recognition of a substrate carbonyl group, of mammalian and bacterial enzymes. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that PmDAP IV is a closer relative of dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8 and DPP9, DPP IV-family enzymes) than DPP IV. These results provide new insights into the substrate recognition mechanism of bacterial DAP IVs and may assist in the development of selective inhibitors for DAP IVs from pathogenic asaccharolytic bacteria, which utilise proteins or peptides as an energy source.

Variation in colostrum management of beef and dairy calves is thought to affect early immune development. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine changes in gene expression and investigate molecular pathways involved in the immune-competence development of neonatal Holstein dairy calves and naturally suckled beef calves using next generation RNA-sequencing during the first week of life. Jugular whole blood samples were collected from Holstein (H) dairy calves (n = 8) artificially fed 5% B.W. colostrum, and from beef calves which were the progenies of Charolais-Limousin (CL; n = 7) and Limousin-Friesian beef suckler cows (LF; n = 7), for subsequent RNA isolation. In dairy calves, there was a surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression possibly due to the stress of separation from the dam. LF calves exhibited early signs of humoral immune development with observed increases in the expression genes coding for Ig receptors, which was not evident in the other breeds by 7 days of age. Immune and health related DEGs identified as upregulated in beef calves are prospective contender genes for the classification of biomarkers for immune-competence development, and will contribute towards a greater understanding of the development of an immune response in neonatal calves.	Colostrum and serum IgG data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variance by histograms, QQ-plots, and formal statistical tests as part of the UNIVARIATE procedure of SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, 2006). Data that were not normally distributed were transformed by raising the variable to the power of lambda. The transformed data were used to calculate P-values. The corresponding least squares means (Lsmeans) and SEM of the non-transformed data are presented in the results for clarity. The serum IgG data were analysed using repeated measures mixed model ANOVA (PROC MIXED, SAS v 9.4) with animal ID, breed (cow breed), sampling time and their interactions included as a fixed effect. REML linear mixed models, was performed to detect significant differences between experimental breeds. The statistical model consisted of the individual animal as the experimental unit in all analyses. Breed was the fixed effect within the model. Animal was included in each model as a random effect. For repeated measures, sampling time was included as the repeated measure. Non-statistically significant interactions were removed from all the models. The type of variance-covariance structure used was chosen depending on the magnitude of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for models run under compound symmetry, unstructured, autoregressive, heterogeneous 1st order autoregressive, or Toeplitz variance-covariance structures. The model with the least AIC value was selected. The differences between mean values were determined by F-tests using Type III sums of squares. The PDIFF was applied as appropriate to evaluate pairwise comparisons between means. A probability of P < 0.05 was selected as the level of significance and statistically tendencies were reported when P < 0.10. Differences between the means were examined using the PDIFF (difftype) option within the MIXED procedure of SAS. Means were considered statistically significant at a probability level of P < 0.05.|

Legal timeliness thresholds overall were achieved, although notification delays can still be shortened for some diseases and therefore need to be monitored by the MHS.

Clients have often spent many hours caring for their elderly pet, strengthening this bond even further. This can make euthanasia a difficult decision for owners. Determining when the time is right to euthanize can be challenging. Discussing the quality of life of ferrets is important in helping owners determine if that time has come. Is the pet able to get around on its own? Is it eating? Is the pet playful or able to enjoy interactions with the client? Are there more good days than bad? Often owners ask if it is better to allow a pet to die at home or be humanely euthanized. If the animal is not in pain or suffering and has an adequate quality of life, keeping the pet home and allowing it to die of ''old age'' may be an option. But often these animals have debilitating disease and may have multiple diseases present that are uncomfortable if not painful to the animal. It is veterinarians' responsibility to discuss with clients the option of euthanasia as an alternative to days or weeks of suffering. Euthanasia can be a painless, gentle end to a long, happy life for many pets. Owners can be allowed to be present with their pet. Presedation may be necessary in some pets, and placement of an intravenous catheter reduces stress for the client and the pet. If euthanasia is chosen, offering burial or cremation services is often appreciated by grieving owners, as are remembrance items, such as clay paws and locks of hair.|

Fractional-order operators including Weyl, Riesz, Riemann-Liouville, Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio, Atangana-Baleanu, Atangana-Gomez, fractal-fractional and others have capability to capture complex and anomalous behavior of dynamical systems that describe a physical or natural phenomenon. The non-local nature of these operators retains memory of the underlying processes which proves to be fruitful in case of epidemiological models since such models are designed to comprehend transmission dynamics of an epidemic which, in turn, has characteristics of memory. Thus, the future works will be devoted to the use of the above operators from fractional calculus for improving the measles system introduced in the present research study.|

However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear. Objectives: We aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and compared them with SARS. Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong (R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic.

The risks at the level of funders involve systematic neglect of certain areas, focus on donor' s interests over that of program recipients, ineffective co-ordination between donors, questionable mechanisms of delivery and excessive loss of funding to ""middle men"". At the level of managers, the risks are corruption, lack of capacity and/or competence, lack of information and /or communication, undue avoidance of governmental structures / preference to non-governmental organizations and exclusion of local expertise.

Non-pharmaceuticals interventions way be an important source of Immunoprotection in the current outbreak. A systematic aerobic training program can prevent the quick spread of the virus from one person to other if our immune system is strong enough. This can be an easy and indispensable way to promote a healthy way of living that may not only prevent communicable diseases but also non communicable diseases. There is a definitive need to further increase our understanding regarding the physiological mechanism responsible to induce the change and strengthen the immunity among sedentary population. There is also need for more and more prescription of moderate intensity exercises by the specialist under supervision and home-based exercises (Which can be easily prescribed once the person is free from Diabetes, Hypertension etc. complication, using the Borg's scale of 6-20 for intensity). As active routine not only have psychological benefits but also physiological benefits. An aerobic exercise program of moderate intensity which can be determined using Borgs scale, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 6-20 (fairly light to somewhat hard) as it has a very good correlation with the physiological measure of exercise intensity (9) . Borg's RPE has a real-world applicability and also seems to be an authentic tool for monitoring and prescribing exercise intensity, which is self-governing in|

This paper presents an empirical spatio-temporal analysis of epidemiological data concerning 2321 SARS-infected patients in Beijing in 2003. We mapped the SARS morbidity data with the spatial data resolution at the level of street and township. Two smoothing methods, Bayesian adjustment and spatial smoothing, were applied to identify the spatial risks and spatial transmission trends. Furthermore, we explored various spatial patterns and spatio-temporal evolution of Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and LISA. Part of this study is targeted at evaluating the effectiveness of public health control measures implemented during the SARS epidemic. The main findings are as follows. (1) The diffusion speed of SARS in the northwest-southeast direction is weaker than that in northeast-southwest direction.	The epidemic of SARS disease in China in 2003 exposed our limit in epidemiology. In public health practice, when an epidemic outbreak occurs, especially for new and emerging diseases, very often action needs to be taken based on sparse knowledge about the pathogen and disease transmission. The public health response mechanisms such as quarantine are often implemented without a proper understanding of their impact. Some measures were complentmented blindly, which resulted in some serious problems, such as high economic and social price. Nowadays, although a large number of researchers have made tremendous progress, but there remains a long distance to reach successes. SARS has pandemic potential, but an effective public health response can curtail this threat. Using the Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic data, this study demonstrates the impor-tance of analyzing spatial patterns and spatio-temporal evolutionary patterns in the context of infectious disease informatics. Our empirical findings provide useful insights that could help better understand disease transmission mechanisms and prepare for and respond to possible reemergence of the SARS epidemic or other novel epidemics of acute infectious diseases. Over the past two decades, with the development of information technology and its extensive application, mass spatio-temporal data storage, management and dynamic update are no longer a problem. Furthermore, spatial statistical methods have been developed rapidly, which have been used widely in a lot of fields, such as resources, environment, ecology, economic and sociality. Spatial statistical methods have been proved a powerful tool to public health. A new discipline, spatial epidemiology, has formed based on the intersection of epidemiology, spatial statistics and geographic information systems, which is the study of the spatial distribution of disease. At present, researching on spatial epidemiology in China is still in its early stage; this paper can promote its development in public health field and provide a sample of using spatial statistical methods to study the infectious disease epidemics, such as avian flu, hand-foot-mouth disease and Influenza A (H1N1).|

This study validated a consensus-base quality indicator set in a large prospective TBI study (CENTER-TBI). Quality of care in critically ill patients with TBI appears amenable to improvement in various areas as indicated by sub-optimal adherence rates and between-centre variation for many quality indicators. Further, our analysis generally shows good feasibility and discriminability but high statistical uncertainty for several outcome indicators. Future research should focus on implementation and quality improvement efforts and continuous reevaluation of the quality indicators. |

With the confi rmation of germ theory by Semmelweis, Pasteur, and others, sepsis was considered as a systemic infection by a pathogenic organism. Although the germ is probably the beginning of the syndrome and one of the major enemies to be identifi ed and fought, sepsis is something wider and more elusive. In this chapter clinically relevant themes of sepsis will be approached to provide an insight of everyday clinical practice for healthcare workers often not directly involved in the patient's management.	Early diagnosis and expedited treatment based on evidencebased medicine can decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality. Extensive collaboration between many fi gures (intensivists, surgeons, infectivologists, microbiologists, pharmacists, nurses, and many others) is required to get this goal. Over that, institutions and healthcare systems are also very important players in sepsis fi ght.|

The overall objectives of the project are to incorporate the concept of overall-process management in life cycle of medical waste into medical waste management and disposal of China, facilitate BAT/BEP application and promotion, improve China's abilities of medical waste management and disposal, promote reduction of medical waste and realize the target of harmlessness, by introducing the advanced experiences in medical waste management and disposal from foreign countries. Currently, most of the activities in demonstration stage have already been completed, and it is expected to reach the dioxin concentration of 0.1 ngTEQ/m 3 in flue gas of 15 incineration (including pyrolysis) facilities. Hence, the project decides to implement the incentive plan among eligible medical waste incineration facilities in China. In this plan, a process with steps as application, review, examination, technical transformation, verification and award was designed. To standardize and externalize the process, an entire package of files including principles, guidelines, quota and criteria, table and checklist templates were developed, considering all the involved stakeholders. As a result, with active involvements and contribution of the MEP, local governments, enterprises, experts and monitoring instructions, the incentive plan vigorously guided and promoted BAT/BEP replication and application for medical waste disposal, avoided and reduced the generation and emission of dioxin POPs and other toxic substances. Currently, there are 8 incinerators which realized the aim of controlling their dioxins emission under limited concentration of 0.1ng TEQ/m 3 in the flue gas.	The Notice of the incentive plan was published on June 4th, 2014 and an explanation meeting was held jointly by FECO and UNIDO in Beijing, June 17th 2014. By the end of 2014, there were 15 incinerators of 13 enterprises passed the examinations and won the qualification to pursue for the incentive fund (see Fig. 2 ). Until the end of May 2015, there are 8 incinerators passed the verification of the incentive plan. In consideration of possible failure and quit of some incinerators, it is necessary to prepare for the successive activities. The following plans are suggested: 1. Make a complementary recruit. If the qualified incinerators exceed the gap, the incentive fund will be awarded with the method of first come first served. 2. Encourage replacement of incinerators with non-incineration technologies.|

All clinical settings, including rehabilitative and infirmary setting, have actively involved in fighting against the infection. The intent of this paper was to reflect on the SARS precautionary measures that had been taken in a severe intellectual disabilities hospital in Hong Kong. Methods A review on six SARS precautionary measures were conducted. They were assessment of risk, formulation of operational guidelines, implementation of infection control measures, education and training of staff, conducting audits and carrying out environmental improvement work. Results Patients were at risk of getting infected from carers, visitors, volunteers, and staff and patients of general hospitals. A SARS Quarantine Unit, isolation ward, was opened to isolate patients who might have had close contact with SARS patients during a stay in a general hospital or when they returned from home leave. Undoubtedly, both staff and relatives participated in preventing the patients from being infected. No day leave and home leave was reported and the number of hospitalization in general hospital was decreased during the critical period. Three infection control audits were conducted and improvement work was carried out subsequently. Conclusion The practice of grouping within a standard isolation room is recommended to continue in the future. Moreover, intensive infection control training for all staff is of highest importance to safeguard the health of both staff and patient.	The SARS outbreaks 'exposed many weaknesses in our health systems. If we are to avoid a similar crisis the next time, we have to greatly improve surveillance and preparedness against emerging and re-emerging diseases. Hospitals are in danger of becoming centres of contagion during an outbreak, and should strengthen infection control' (Shigeru Omi, directorgeneral, Western Pacific Region, World Health Organization).|

The first part of the paper studies the descriptive statistics and the influence of demographic parameters, namely age and gender, in the clinical recovery-period of COVID-19 patients. The second part of the paper is on identifying the distribution of the length of the recovery-period for the patients. We identify a piecewise analysis of three different periods, identified based on trends of both positive confirmation and clinical recovery of COVID-19. As expected, the overall recovery rate has reduced drastically during the exponential increase of incidences. However, our in-depth analysis shows that there is a shift in the age-group of incidences to the younger population, and the recovery-period of the younger population is considerably lower. Here, we have estimated the recovery rate to be 0.125. Overall, the prognosis of COVID-19 indicates an improvement in recovery rate owing to the government-mandated practices of restricted mobility of the older population and aggressive contact tracing.	In summary, we have looked at the demographic data and timeline of the first 1000 COVID-19 patients in Singapore during January 23-April 01, 2020. We have closely investigated the data on the positive confirmation and discharge/clinical recovery dates of 245 patients who recovered during this time period. We have used regression analysis, subsequent to a descriptive statistical analysis, to get an estimate of recovery-period ∆t r (i.e., hospital length of stay (LoS)). We have found that the ∆t r is time-varying, after performing periodization to find three significant periods, namely P 1 (January 23-February 03), P 2 (February 04-March 16), and P 3 (March 17-April 01). The estimates of ∆t r varied from ∼17 days in P 1 to ∼10 days in P 2 to ∼8 days in P 3 . We have used the loess model for time-series data to demonstrate the negative slope of the regression curve of ∆t r in P 3 , in particular. We then estimated period-wise ∆t r using generalized linear models for multivariate (linear) regression with Poisson and negative binomial distributions for count data. This shows an improvement in the values published for ∆t r , i.e., 20 days [11] and 15 days [10] . This has led us to estimate the current recovery rate γ in the SIR model to be |

Although remarkable technological advances have been made in the treatment of coronary heart disease, there is as yet no treatment that can sufficiently suppress the progression of atherosclerosis, including neointimal thickening. Therefore, a precise understanding of the mechanism of neointimal hyperplasia will provide the development of new technologies. Both ApoE-KO and LDLR-KO mice have been employed to generate other relevant mouse models of cardiovascular disease through breeding strategies. Although these mice are effective tools for the investigation of atherosclerosis, development of a progressive atherosclerotic lesion takes a long time, resulting in increase of both the costs and the space needed for the research. Thus, it is necessary to develop simpler tools that would allow easy evaluation of atherosclerosis in mouse models. In this review, we discuss our experience in generating mouse models of cuff-induced injury of the femoral artery and attempt to provide a better understanding of cuff-induced neointimal formation.	Cuff placement causes mild endothelial cell damage, SMC proliferation and migration, and inflammation of the adventitia. This is a convenient and reproducible tool and is relatively less expensive and time-consuming. This tool is effective for analyzing the mechanism of vascular remodeling using mice, including genetically engineered mice. Further experiments to identify the precise mechanisms of neointimal hyperplasia by using this tool will provide the development of new technologies in the future.|

Blood sucking Diptera (Nycteribiidae, Streblidae) and Siphonaptera (Ischnopsyllidae)	New data on bat ectoparasites from Mindoro Island, Philippines are reported. Eighty-three individuals of ectoparasitic insects representing seven species of Nycteribiidae and five species of Streblidae (both Diptera), and one species of Ischnopsyllidae (Siphonaptera) were recorded from 11 bat species captured in Naujan Lake National Park, Mindoro Oriental Province, Philippines. Raymondia pagodarum is a new record for the country. Eight species are also newly recorded for Mindoro Island, including Cyclopodia garrula, Leptocyclopodia ferrarii mabuhai, Megastrebla parvior, Brachytarsina amboinensis, B. werneri, R. pagodarum, R. pseudopagodarum and Thaumapsylla longiforceps. Five species are newly documented on various hosts: C. horsfieldi on Pteropus pumilus, M. parvior on Macroglossus minimus, B. amboinensis on Hipposideros diadema, B. werneri on Rhinolophus arcuatus and R. pagodarum on Hipposideros bicolor.	During our survey, we were able to capture only five species of insectivorous bats. However, a further 21 species of bats have been recorded in Mindoro. These insect bats are usually cave dwelling and we failed to document any cave within the vicinities of Naujan Lake. More extensive collections are necessary to document more ectoparasite species that could be new host and locality records or new to science. Large samples are also necessary to determine and establish patterns of host-parasite relationships. During our sampling, we used the typical mist nets, which are less efficient in capturing echolocating bats that easily evade these nets. Thus, use of multiple methods to capture host bats is recommended for future studies. in specimen preparations. Special thanks to the anonymous reviewer for improving the manuscript.|

Recent advances in technology have permitted the identification of several virus receptors, increasing our understanding of the significance of this initial virus-cell and virus-host interaction. Virus binding was previously considered to involve simple recognition and attachment to a single cell surface molecule by virus attachment proteins. The classical concept of these as single entities that participate in a lock-and-key-type process has been superseded by new data indicating that binding can he a multistep process, often involving different virus-attachment proteins and more than one host-cell receptor.	We wish to thank our collaborators and colleagues for their contributions and discussions of the concepts described here.|

Furthermore, many viral zoonoses have emerged or reemerged in recent years, highlighting the importance of such diseases. Emerging viral zoonoses encompass a vast number of different viruses and many different transmission modes. There are many factors influencing the epidemiology of the various zoonoses, such as ecological changes, changes in agriculture and food production, the movement of pathogens, including via travel and trade, human behavior and demographical factors, and microbial changes and adaptation. Costeffective prevention and control of emerging viral zoonoses necessitates an interdisciplinary and holistic approach and international cooperation. Surveillance, laboratory capability, research, training and education, and last but not least, information and communication are key elements.	Interdisciplinary and international collaboration are crucial for the rapid identification and effective management of viral zoonoses. The pivotal role of international organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization, and the Office International des Epizooties is exemplified by the response to the current avian influenza outbreak in Asia and Europe. Containment of viral zoonoses relies on efficient national, regional, and international cross-sectional networks to improve data sharing and enable a timely and effective response to disease outbreaks.|

Simple flocked nasal swabs are recommended as well as multiplex PCR for screening. Unfortunately, opportunities to use specific antivirals are currently limited. Infection control measures should be implemented to avoid transmission. Virus-positive patients should be strictly isolated and cared for by nurses who are not responsible for the care of babies without the virus. It is advisable to monitor the duration of virus shedding, although it is unclear how contagious asymptomatic viruspositive patients are. The role that family and staff members play in transmission still needs to be studied.|

These medicines, essential to palliative care, are regulated under the international drug control conventions overseen by United Nations (UN) specialized agencies and treaty bodies and under national drug control laws. Those national laws and regulations directly affect bedside availability of Internationally Controlled Essential Medicines (ICEMs). The complex interaction between national regulatory systems and global supply chains (now impacted by COVID-19 pandemic) directly affects bedside availability of ICEMs and patient care. Despite decades of global civil society advocacy in the UN system, ICEMs have remained chronically unavailable, inaccessible and unaffordable in Lower-and-Middle Income Countries, and there are recent reports of shortages in High Income Countries as well. The most prevalent symptoms in COVID-19 are breathlessness, cough, drowsiness, anxiety, agitation and delirium. Frequently used medicines include opioids such as morphine or fentanyl and midazolam, all of them listed as ICEMs.	This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.|

New and virulent strains of bacteria and viruses, including the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, make this problem particularly important [44] . We demonstrate that interhospital transfers of critically ill patients might form a vector for national-scale transmission of highly resistant microorganisms. Furthermore, we suggest that coordination between hospitals in allocating infection control resources could result in substantially decreased interhospital transmissibility with substantially lower total cost. The frequent transfer of patients between our ICUs results in substantial nationwide interdependence, and acknowledging and managing that interdependence may be important to public health and security.|

As of May 2020, Turkey is 3 among the top ten countries with the most cases. A comprehensive genomic 4 characterization of the virus isolates in Turkey is yet to be carried out. Here, we built a 5 phylogenetic tree with 15,277 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-6 CoV-2) genomes. We identified the subtypes based on the phylogenetic clustering in 7 comparison with the previously annotated classifications. We performed a phylogenetic 8 analysis of the first thirty SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated and sequenced in Turkey. Our 9 results suggest that the first introduction of the virus to the country is earlier than the first 10 reported case of infection. Virus genomes isolated from Turkey are dispersed among most 11 types in the phylogenetic tree. Two of the seventeen sub-clusters were found enriched 12 with the isolates of Turkey, which likely have spread expansively in the country. Finally, 13 we traced virus genomes based on their phylogenetic placements. This analysis suggested 14 multiple independent international introductions of the virus and revealed a hub for the 15 inland transmission. We released a web application to track the global and interprovincial 16 virus spread of the isolates from Turkey in comparison to thousands of genomes 17 worldwide.	D614G mutation is claimed to be more aggressive because of its easier transmission. A 249 recent report also showed that viruses with 614G genotype results in higher fatality rates 250 (Becerra-Flores and Cardozo 2020). 23 out of 30 genomes we analyzed have 614G 251 mutation. D614G mutation seems to have mutated with the two synonymous mutations 252 in ORF1ab (Figure 4) . Besides 614G, three more amino acid substitutions were 253 identified in the spike protein (Table 2) |

Caffeine (LC 50 = 306 μg/mL) (Meyer et al., 1982) is used as a positive control and methanol (500 μL) as a solvent and a negative control in the bioassay experiments. The current scenario of viral diseases is lethal and there is an upsurge in new viral diseases and resistance to existing viral infections worldwide. The currently accessible antivirals, however effective, are exorbitant and past the reach of a majority of individuals. Along these lines, the advancement of safe, effective, and low-cost antiviral medications, for example, RT inhibitors, is among the top priorities, as many viral infections are not yet treatable and have high death rates. For the past few years, substantial work has been carried out regarding the effectiveness of medicinal plants on HIV infection (Premanathan et al., 1999; Calabrese et al., 2000; Asres et al., 2001) and an increasing popularity of over-the-counter plant products containing orthodox drugs has been observed. The main focus is to lower the adverse effects associated with viral infections and an inclination toward synergistic interactions of multiple molecules present in plant extracts. Be that as it may, because mostly pharmacological mechanisms of the combinations are not studied, antagonistic impacts or remedial disappointments have been seen (Chan et al., 2000) . A prerequisite that should be considered significant for medicinal plants is to identify and standardize the method of extract preparation, the suitable season for collecting plant material, and the details of its administration (Chattopadhyay et al., 2006) . As a lot of plant extracts and subsequent formulations have shown significant outcomes, it seems to be rational to endorse the idea of the study of medicinal plants as a quest to find potential antivirals.|

However, prognostic role of coinfection remains unclear. Objective: Evaluate relation between respiratory viral confection and illness severity in children. Study design: MEDLINE (through PUBMED), EMBASE, EBSCO, LILACS databases were searched up to March 2015 by two independent reviewers. Studies assessing severity of viral coinfection in patients aged less than 18 years were included. Standardized forms were used for data extraction of population, study design, clinical syndromes, virus combinations compared and severity outcomes. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed through EPHPP and GRADE. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age and viral combinations. Results: Of 5218 records screened, 43 were included in analysis. Viral coinfection did not influence risks of all outcomes assessed: length of stay (mean difference in days in coinfection, −0.10 [95% confidence interval: −0.51 to 0.31]), length of supplemental oxygen (−0.42 [−1.05 to 0.20]), need of hospitalization (odds ratio of coinfection, 0.96 [95% confidence interval: 0.61-1.51]), supplemental oxygen (0.94 [0.66 to 1.34]), need of intensive care (0.99 [0.64 to 1.54]), mechanical ventilation (0.81 [0.33 to 2.01]) and death (2.22 [0.83 to 5.95]). Sub-analyses according to age and viral combinations have not shown influence of these factors in outcomes. Conclusions: Respiratory viral coinfection did not increase severity in all outcomes assessed. Further studies are necessary to confirm this finding, especially regarding role of specific viral interactions.	Dr. Mattiello and Dr Sarria conceptualized and designed the study, supervised data extraction data from studies, performed statistical analysis and interpretation of data, critically revised the manuscript and approved the final manuscript as submitted.|

All of them share high mutability and a great potential for adaptation that makes their eradication enormously difficult. The isolation of drug-resistant mutants, the emergence of new diseases in humans caused by viruses that usually are maintained in animal reservoirs or the appearance of viral variants able to resist the action of the immune system of the host constitute important challenges for research in this century. One of the most promising strategies for the control of viral diseases consists in the increase of the error rate of viral replication above the threshold that prevents further transmission of genetic information. The difficulty to apply lethal mutagenesis to the treatment of viral infections largely rely, as it happens with other antiviral drugs, on the emergence of resistant mutants, which in this case would probably be those carrying high fidelity polymerases. The knowledge of the exact mechanisms leading a population to error catastrophe implies a detailed study of the composition and structure of the mutant spectrum of the quasi-species. In this sense, the comparison with the structure of bottlenecked populations that have accumulated a large number of mutations still compatible with survival can help to design new strategies for the extinction of infectivity.|
154	e296fa71274bad6cabcf683a2ba47e58b1326877	International Journal of Health Geographics Musings on privacy issues in health research involving disaggregate geographic data about individuals	This paper offers a state-of-the-art overview of the intertwined privacy, confidentiality, and security issues that are commonly encountered in health research involving disaggregate geographic data about individuals. Key definitions are provided, along with some examples of actual and potential security and confidentiality breaches and related incidents that captured mainstream media and public interest in recent months and years. The paper then goes on to present a brief survey of the research literature on location privacy/confidentiality concerns and on privacy-preserving solutions in conventional health research and beyond, touching on the emerging privacy issues associated with online consumer geoinformatics and location-based services. The 'missing ring' (in many treatments of the topic) of data security is also discussed. Personal information and privacy legislations in two countries, Canada and the UK, are covered, as well as some examples of recent research projects and events about the subject. Select highlights from a June 2009 URISA (Urban and Regional Information Systems Association) workshop entitled 'Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality of Geographic Data in Health Research' are then presented. The paper concludes by briefly charting the complexity of the domain and the many challenges associated with it, and proposing a novel, 'one stop shop' case-based reasoning framework to streamline the provision of clear and individualised guidance for the design and approval of new research projects (involving geographical identifiers about individuals), including crisp recommendations on which specific privacy-preserving solutions and approaches would be suitable in each case.	"Kamel Boulos (unpublished research notes, 2008 Boulos (unpublished research notes, -2009 proposed the development of a case-based reasoning software framework (cf. case law) that covers, and continuously ""learns from"", the growing body of possible and emerging health research scenarios and applications involving precise geographical identifiers about individuals. The goal of such a 'one stop shop' framework would be to streamline the provision of clear and individualised guidance for the design and approval of new research projects, including crisp recommendations on which specific privacy-preserving solution(s) and approach(es) would be suitable in each case. This would spare researchers and IRBs the need to 'reinvent the wheel' with each new study, saving them precious time and efforts spent investigating the same issues every time, and preventing avoidable errors and omissions along the way. This decision framework should ideally have an easy-to-use, wizard-based visual frontend, guiding users throughout the whole process of describing and diagnosing their needs, and proposing (with appropriate explanations/justifications) suitable solutions to address them.|"

Its aim is to add more disease information, as necessary for global epidemiological surveillance headed by WHO. The results of AGSnet obtained so far indicate that the system was able to discover some valuable information on infectious diseases of international importance, happening in special areas. Although the information is irregular, it may be added to the WHO pooled surveillance data worldwide. Further development of this system seem to be desirable, including assessment as regards its sensitivity and resulting public-health action. It should be noted, however, that such network in no way replaces or negates the need for strong national surveillance, alert, and response mechanisms.|
157	771835967deee9932be39baadefcc8c1485d39d3	Transcription of feline calicivirus RNA	We report here the cloning and 3' sequence determination of feline calicivirus strain F9. Subcloning the 3' terminus enabled the production of strand specific probes for RNA synthesis. We extend the number of virus specific RNAs detected intracellularly to 8, and show that numbers 1-5 are represented as negative strands which may serve as templates in the synthesis of these RNAs.	There is considerable antigenic variation within the one serotype of FCV and it is likely that a spectrum of antigenic types may exist [14] . The restriction maps generated for the 3' end of FCV strain CF1/68 FIV [13] and strain F9 (this report) also differ and this suggests that these differences will be represented at sequence level. The sizes of the RNAs reported here also differ from those reported by Neill and Mengeling. To some extent this may be accounted for by the different nucleic acid markers employed (ssRNA or ssDNA) in the two studies. However, strain variation in polypeptide size is known and R N A sizes may therefore also differ. Comparative sequence analysis and investigation of any strain-specific pathogenesis is urgently required.|

Here, we demonstrated that, among five accessory proteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) tested, 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 were capable of activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and significantly enhanced interleukin 8 (IL-8) promoter activity. Furthermore, 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 expression in A549 cells enhanced production of inflammatory chemokines that were known to be up-regulated in SARS-CoV infection. Our results suggest potential involvement of 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 proteins in the pathological inflammatory responses in SARS.	Both 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 proteins are expressed in SARS-CoVinfected cells [22] . 3a/X1 protein is a cell membrane-associated protein, potentially secreted and incorporated into the virion [23] [24] [25] . 7a/X4 protein is located in the cytoplasm [26] . Recent studies reported that over-expression of 3a/X1 and 7a/X4 induced apoptosis of the cell [27, 28] . Our results indicated that these cell-associated SARS-CoV accessory gene products could activate NF-jB and JNK, and might be strong candidates to induce pathological inflammatory responses in SARS. |

Although great efforts have been made to find effective medication, there are still no drugs that truly cure viral infections. There are currently approximately 90 drugs approved for the treatment of human viral infections. As resistance toward available antiviral drugs has become a global threat to health, there is an intrinsic need to identify new scaffolds that are useful in discovering innovative, less toxic and highly active antiviral agents. 1,3,4-Thiadiazole derivatives have been extensively studied due to their pharmacological profile, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. This review provides an overview of the various synthetic compounds containing the 2-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety that has been evaluated for antiviral activity against several viral strains and could be considered possible prototypes for the development of new antiviral drugs.

Given the severity of illness of such patients at the time of surgery, lung transplant recipients require particular attention in the immediate post-operative period to ensure optimal short-term and long-term outcomes. The management of such patients involves active involvement of a multidisciplinary team versed in common post-operative complications. This review provides an overview of such complications as they pertain to the practitioners caring for post-operative lung transplant recipients. Causes and treatment of conditions affecting early morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients will be detailed, including primary graft dysfunction, cardiovascular and surgical complications, and immunologic and infectious issues. Additionally, lung donor management issues and bridging the critically ill potential lung transplant recipient to transplantation will be discussed.

The H1N1 pandemic, SARS, Ebola epidemic, and Zika pandemic are recent global events of public health concern (Fineberg 2014; Dixon et al. 2014; Fauci and Morens 2016) . In addition, other local crises such as the US opioid epidemic (US Department of Health and Human Services 2017), have reinforced the need to establish bidirectional communications between clinical practices and public health authorities. As a result, organized healthcare has established and adopted protocols to rapidly handle patients and related risks adequately. It is now common in clinical practices to hear the question ""have you travelled abroad recently?"" or ""have you been to places experiencing a public health emergency?"" Furthermore, guidance from public health authorities can be seen posted throughout halls or clinical spaces in practices. These messages and warnings are now also part of electronic health records and patients are questioned and treated accordingly. Public health authorities (federal, state, and local) continue to develop strategies to reach both clinicians and the general public and having the capacity to handle electronic health record data is a high priority for all of them."

Previous studies have shown that the variation, especially the Ϫ871A/G and Ϫ336A/G in DC-SIGN promoter influenced the susceptibility to tuberculosis. We therefore investigated whether polymorphisms in the DC-SIGN gene were associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in an eastern Chinese population. A total of 237 culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis case patients and 244 controls were genotyped for Ϫ871A/G and Ϫ336A/G by pyrosequencing. Our results suggested that the 2 promoter variants of DC-SIGN gene were not associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in Chinese. Further analysis showed that the allele -336G was associated with a protective effect against fever in pulmonary tuberculosis patients, but not against cavity formation. In addition, we compared the allelic frequencies of Ϫ871A/G and Ϫ336A/G in African, Caucasian, and Asian groups. The results showed that the tw forms of allelic frequencies detected Chinese individuals in our study were similar to the reported frequencies in other Asian populations but differed significantly from those in the African and Caucasian groups studied. ᭧	In conclusion, no significant association with tuberculosis was observed for the two variants of Ϫ871A/G and Ϫ336A/G in DC-SIGN gene in a Chinese population. However, the -336G allele was weakly associated with PTB patients' fever. In addition, our results offered the SNP frequencies in an eastern Chinese population, which might be useful for the study in ethnic groups.|

Modelling may provide answers to hitherto unknown problems and greatly expand our knowledge base from actual study data. Initially, scientific community suffered from lack of large data sets particularly from curated biological activity. These limitations have been overcome, to some extent, with the availability of many open access initiatives like PubChem, DrugBank, ChemBank, and ChemSpider. Nevertheless, problem still persists, as there are limitations in managing high capacity data in sync with generated big data and the ability to transform these data into meaningful knowledge. Data integration from divergent sources at different platform, coupled with increasingly complex multidisciplinary approaches, increased the need of data analysis and interpretation.|

As of 24 March 2020, the virus has caused viral pneumonia in tens of thousands of people in Wuhan, China, and ten of thousands of cases in 184 other countries and territories. This study explores the potential use of Google Trends (GT) to monitor worldwide interest in this COVID-19 epidemic. GT was chosen as a source of reverse engineering data, given the interest in the topic. Methods: Current data on COVID-19 is retrieved from (GT) using one main search topic: Coronavirus. Geographical settings for GT are worldwideResults: The results show that the highest worldwide peak in the first wave of demand for information was on 31 January 2020. After the first peak, the number of new cases reported daily rose for 6 days. A second wave started on 21 February 2020 after the outbreaks were reported in Italy, with the highest peak on 16 March 2020. The second wave is six times as big as the first wave. The number of new cases reported daily is rising day by day. Conclusion: This short communication gives a brief introduction to how the demand for information on coronavirus epidemic is reported through GT.	The limitation of the study is GT data about China because of the general unavailability of Google in China. Another limitation is that data about South Korea, Italy and Iran is changing rapidly every day, thus results are only relevant to the reported date.|
170	43d195717d02e34be24cc80d371079fd9c346338	Coronavirus reverse genetic systems: Infectious clones and replicons	Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect humans and many animal species, and are associated with respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and central nervous system diseases. The large size of the CoV genome and the instability of some CoV replicase gene sequences during its propagation in bacteria, represent serious obstacles for the development of reverse genetic systems similar to those used for smaller positive sense RNA viruses. To overcome these limitations, several alternatives to more conventional plasmid-based approaches have been established in the last 13 years. In this report, we briefly review and discuss the different reverse genetic systems developed for CoVs, paying special attention to the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV).	The potential risk to public health posed by SARS-CoV and other CoVs, and the lack of specific antiviral agents and vaccines, have triggered a global effort to study this family of viruses at the molecular level in order to develop effective strategies to prevent and control CoV infections. Molecular genetic analysis of the structure and function of RNA virus genomes has been profoundly advanced by the availability of full-length cDNA clones. In the case of CoV, the huge genome size and the instability of specific CoV cDNA sequences in bacterial systems hindered the development of infectious cDNA clones until recently. A tremendous amount of creativity in the CoV field resulted in the development of four independent and unique reverse genetic systems that overcame these problems. These reverse genetic systems have been established using non-traditional approaches, which are based on the use of targeted recombination, BACs, in vitro ligation of CoV cDNA fragments, and vaccinia virus as a vector for the propagation of CoV genomic cDNAs. The availability of CoV full-length infectious clones and recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes constitute important tools for the study of CoV replication and transcription mechanisms, virus-host interaction and pathogenesis, and also for the rapid and rational development and testing of genetically defined vaccines. In addition to full-length cDNA clones, the generation of CoV replicons has greatly facilitated the functional analysis of viral replication and transcription, as well as the analysis of antiviral drugs without the need of manipulating infectious viruses.|
171	bafffaf17be4302a4a6e79b3f65b9238ab00c258	ARTICLE Generation of therapeutic antisera for emerging viral infections	The recent Ebola virus outbreak has highlighted the therapeutic potential of antisera and renewed interest in this treatment approach. While human convalescent sera may not be readily available in the early stages of an outbreak, antisera of animal origin can be produced in a short time frame. Here, we compared adjuvanted virus-like particles (VLP) with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), both expressing the Ebola virus antigens. The neutralizing antibody titers of rabbits immunized with adjuvanted VLPs were similar to those immunized with the replication-competent VSV, indicating that presentation of the antigen in its native conformation rather than de novo antigen expression is essential for production of functional antibodies. This approach also yielded high-titer antisera against Nipah virus glycoproteins, illustrating that it is transferable to other virus families. Multiple-step immunoglobulin G purification using a two-step 20-40% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by protein A affinity chromatography resulted in 90% recovery of functionality and sustained in vivo stability. Adjuvanted VLP-based immunization strategies are thus a promising approach for the rapid generation of therapeutic antisera against emerging infections.

172	69faaacdd695a0b0d366b8bb3b98a94ce3176085	Chapter 17 Design of Small Interfering RNAs for Antiviral Applications	RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for sequence-specific target RNA degradation in animals and plants, which plays an essential role in gene regulation. In addition, it is believed to function as a defense against viruses and transposons. In recent years, RNAi has become a widely used approach for studying gene function by targeted cleavage of a specific RNA. Moreover, the technology has been developed as a new therapeutic option that has already made its way into clinical testing.	18. An m.o.i. of 0.1 is suitable for many viruses, but in some cases may need to be adjusted. The control infection should show as many individual plaques as can be reliably counted. An effective siRNA will appreciably reduce the number of plaques, while a weak siRNA may only lead to a slight reduction. A large number of distinguishable plaques on the control plate will simplify the recognition of weak siRNAs, which may be desirable if further optimization is possible. 19 . FCS within a medium may interfere with viral infection efficiency. 20 . Incubation time depends on the infection cycle of a specific virus. 21 . Neutral red as well as crystal violet is taken up by healthy cells, but not by dead cells. Plaques therefore appear as clear circles against the red/violet background. If the clear areas overlap too much, it is difficult to recognize individual plaques and infection time should be reduced. If plaques are too small to be easily read, try extending infection time, though it could also be an indication of a defective or weakened strain. 22 . The staining can be accelerated by using crystal violet solution. To this end, fix the cells with 10% TCA for 10 min at room temperature. Then remove the agar without disturbing the cell monolayer and add 500 ml of crystal violet solution (0.5% solution in PBS) to each of the wells and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (see Note 21) . Remove the stain by aspiration and wash with PBS. Invert the plate, and count the plaques of each well. Calculate the viral titer as described in Subheading 3.5.2, step 22.|

Background Since Rothenberg first performed thoracoscopic repair for esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) successfully in 2000, thoracoscopic repair has achieved status as a routine procedure worldwide. Previously, an international multicenter study reported that this procedure was not inferior to conventional open surgery. However, thoracoscopic surgery is a highly difficult operation for surgeons and anesthesiologists; as a result, the safety and efficacy of the surgery is still under debate. Considering these circumstances, the purpose of this study was to analyze the results of single-center thoracoscopic surgery and to compare the outcomes relative to the patient's weight at the time of surgery. Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients with EA/TEF who underwent thoracoscopic surgery in a single center between October 2008 and February 2017. Results In total, 41 cases of thoracoscopic repair of EA/TEF were performed. Upon subgrouping by over and under 2000 g of body weight at the time of operation, 34 were found to be over 2000 g and seven were under 2000 g. Intraoperative factors and events were not significantly different between the two groups. Additionally, most of the postoperative outcomes, including the rate of postoperative leakage and strictures, showed no difference. On the other hand, the under 2000 g group had more gastroesophageal reflux requiring fundoplication than did the heavier group (P = 0.04). Conclusions The results of this center's thoracoscopic repair of EA/TEF were not inferior to other centers' outcomes. Additionally, the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were similar despite differences in weight at operation. Therefore, thoracoscopic repair might be a feasible surgical option for infants weighing less than 2000 g when performed by a surgeon and anesthesiologist team who are experienced in pediatric thoracoscopic surgery.

Rhinovirus is most frequently-detected pathogen; followed by respiratory syncytial virus; metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus; enterovirus and coronavirus. In addition; viral infection; in combination with genetics; allergen exposure; microbiome and other pathogens; may play a role in asthma development. In particular; asthma development has been linked to wheezing-associated respiratory viral infections in early life. To understand underlying mechanisms of viral-induced airways disease; investigators have studied respiratory viral infections in small animals. This report reviews animal models of human respiratory viral infection employing mice; rats; guinea pigs; hamsters and ferrets. Investigators have modeled asthma exacerbations by infecting mice with allergic airways disease. Asthma development has been modeled by administration of virus to immature animals. Small animal models of respiratory viral infection will identify cell and molecular targets for the treatment of asthma.	Thus, despite limitations, studies have yielded valuable information about viral pathogenesis and potential mechanisms of asthma exacerbation and development. Recent studies have identified specific roles for epithelial-derived innate cytokines and their cellular targets. In some cases, cell and molecular mediators identified in animal models have been confirmed in human subjects. Further experimentation in mouse models will undoubtedly contribute to the development of new therapeutic interventions for asthma. |

Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of all infections caused by S. maltophilia in HSCT recipients in a single center in Israel during a 4 year period. Results Of 570 patients undergoing HSCT, 19 patients with an invasive S. maltophilia infection were identified. Sixteen had allogeneic HSCT and 3 had autologous HSCT. Seventeen patients (90%) had an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC) at the time of infection. S. maltophilia infections were detected in three clinical settings: as a complication of prolonged neutropenia (n = 9), as a CVCrelated non-neutropenic infection occurring after CVC manipulation (n = 8) and as a respiratory tract infection (n = 2). Eleven patients (58%) had a polymicrobial infection. Ten patients (52.6%) received carbapenems during the previous month. The treatment for all patients included broad spectrum antibiotics, which were switched according to susceptibilities upon identification of the isolates. All isolates were susceptible in vitro to TMP-SMX. CVCs were removed in 12 patients (70%). Six patients, all after allogeneic HSCT, died. The CVC was removed in only two of the five patients with CVCs who died. Conclusions Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen in HSCT recipients, both in the early neutropenic phase and in the non-neutropenic phase. It is commonly associated with the presence and manipulation of an indwelling CVC. Removal of the CVC in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy (TMP-SMX) is crucial for infection control.	In summary, we describe S. maltophilia infections in a population of HSCT recipients. S. maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen that may infect these patients in the early neutropenic phase, but also in the nonneutropenic phase. It is commonly associated with an indwelling CVC. Attempts should be made to remove CVCs once infection is detected. Moreover, while neutropenia duration and mucositis are factors that are difficult to control, unnecessary CVCs should be avoided and removed as soon as possible. Although resistant to many antimicrobial agents, the infection usually responds well to the combination of appropriate antibiotic therapy with TMP-SMX and CVC removal.|
177	61d6a568f97488b71a7ad350bbdfe784a4e224e3	Association of the Infectious Bronchitis Virus 3c Protein with the Virion Envelope		For example the second ORF (5b) of MHV mRNA 5 can encode a 10.2K protein with a hydrophobic amino terminal region (16, directly or after immunoprecipitation with anti-3c antiserum. plBT3-radiolabeled 3a, b, and c polypeptide markers were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation as described for Fig. 1 22 ) and the corresponding genetic location on the TGEV genome has the potential to encode a 1 OK polypeptide with striking similarity to 3c (30) . Furthermore, the bovine coronavirus genome at this point contains an ORF which could encode a 9.5K hydrophobic protein (1). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of these four proteins (Fig. 4 ) reveals some interesting common features. First, the amino acids flanking the proposed transmembrane region of the four proteins are negatively charged at the N-terminus and positively charged at the C-terminus. This arrangement could allow them to adopt the orientation of class III integral membrane proteins (I I), i.e., with the N-terminus on the outside. It has also been observed that the predicted molecular weight of the 3c protein of IBV, the 5b protein of MHV, and the 9.5K protein of BCV is consistent with their migration rate in SDS-PAGE (I, 16, 17, 22) suggesting that these proteins contain uncleaved signal peptides; this is again consistent with the possibility that they are, like the M2 protein of influenza A virus, class III integral membrane proteins (11, 20) . A further common feature is the occurrence of a cysteine residue 34 or 35 nt downstream of the charged amino acid at the N-terminal end of the proposed transmembrane region, which may play a role, as described above for the influenza M2 protein, in forming disulfide linkages. Thus it may be that 3c-like proteins are conserved across the Coronaviridae and may play a similar role in viral replication. |

This balance should be determined by the epidemiologic characteristics of the disease and the methods available and practical for its control, and not by the level of social opprobrium against populations affected, societal discomfort with transmission through illicit or intimate behavior, or fear and ignorance.|

Thus, preventing viral transmission by case isolation, quarantine, and social distancing is essential to slowing its spread. Here we model social networks using weighted graphs, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent contact. As public health measures are implemented, connectivity in the graph decreases, resulting in lower effective reproductive numbers, and reduced viral transmission. For COVID-19, model parameters were derived from the coronavirus epidemic in China, validated by epidemic data in Italy, then applied to the United States. We calculate that, in the U.S., the public is able to contain viral transmission by limiting the average number of contacts per person to less than 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. This increases the average social distance between individuals to 10 degrees of separation.

Wild-type core and OD1 variants of gp120 were immobolized onto CM5 sensor chips at densities of 430 and 385 RU, respectively. To minimize nonspecific binding of D1D2-Igαtp, alcohol dehydrogenase (S. cerevisiae, Sigma) was immobilized onto the reference surface and 0.1% carboxymethyl dextran was added to the buffer. Increasing concentrations of D1D2-Igαtp were allowed to bind for 2 min and then to dissociate for 2 min, with a flow rate of 30uL/min. Concentrations of D1D2-Igαtp (right panels) were 0.62 nM (cyan), 1.25 nM (red), 2.50 nM (green) and 5.00 nM (blue) for wild-type core (top row), and 1.25 nM (cyan), 2.50 nM (red), 5.00 nM (green) and 10.0 nM (blue) for OD1 (bottom row). |

By testing both compounds against a range of challenge viruses, a clearer profile of the in vivo efficacy and toxicity of each compound was achieved. Pharmacological evaluation of the two agents and thorough studies of their effect on the pathogenesis of the diseases were beyond the scope of this study. Although the studies reported here do not preclude effectiveness of these two agents in other viral infections of humans or experimental animals, they provide minimal support for more extensive evaluations of IDU and AZU efficacy in human trials. It is of interest to note that two placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies initiated to evaluate the effectiveness of IDU in treatment of H. hominis encephalitis were terminated because of the severe toxicity associated with the use of this drug [8] .|

Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies. The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified. Main body: Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75-7.54). No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures. Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles. The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material. Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures. A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection. Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission.	There is an opportunity to perform research to quantify the risk of COVID-19 transmission from patients to health care workers performing aerosol-generating otolaryngology procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most important studies would be cohort studies that aim to estimate the risk of developing COVID-19 from performing otolaryngology AGMPs, and whether different types of PPE, training and/or doffing procedures modify the outcomes. Measuring the level of aerosolized viral particles in rooms where AGMPs are being performed on patients with COVID-19 would provide indirect evidence of the degree to which these procedures put health care workers at risk of aerosolized transmission, and whether exposure concentration affects risk of infection and/or severity of disease. |

Here we identified two novel HLA-A*0201 restricted NP epitopes, named H5N1 NP373-381 AMDSNTLEL (NP373) and NP458-466 FQGRGVFEL (NP458), using computational bioinformatic analysis. The NP peptides showed a high binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 on T2 cells, and were able to induce the activation of the cytotoxic T cells in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We examined the potential of using NP373 and NP458 peptide sequences supplemented with a single-chain trimer as potential DNA vaccine candidates in an HHD transgenic mouse model. A gene gun delivery system was used for administrating the vaccine candidates into the animals. The results from cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assays indicated that a significant amount of IFN-c was secreted by the T cells of the vaccinated mice, and the T cells were able to eliminate the corresponding peptide-loaded T2 cells. The discovery of these novel immunogenic NP peptides provides valuable information for avian flu vaccine design and construction.	In summary, we identified two novel HLA-A*0201 T-cell epitopes, NP373 and NP458, in the H5N1 viral NP. Our results indicate that these two epitopes are capable of inducing a strong immune response, and that the SCT system can improve the immune responses. The finding of these novel cytotoxic T-cell epitopes presented provides significant information for the development of a human H5N1 vaccine. In the future, experiments using a mixture of SCT-DNA constructs encoding H5N1 NP epitopes instead of using one type of SCT-DNA construct encoding a single peptide are necessary to investigate whether there are any improvements for the immunogenicity.|
186	1eed2b953b4f2fa64c2779b98f6e7b8cb92278de	predCOVID-19: A Systematic Study of Clinical Predictive Models for Coronavirus Disease 2019	is a rapidly emerging respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%, 51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine which clinical features are predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive models trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources.

187	73dcb608131147679066aeaa03ce878d328f5542	Antibody responsiveness during immunization and challenge of genetically modified antibody responder mice with murine hepatitis virus 3	The aim of this study was to evaluate some immunological patterns involved in natural and acquired resistance against MHV3 using the original model of genetically modified lines of mice selected for high (H III ) and low (L III ) antibody responsiveness. As previously shown, a lower pre-existing anti-MHV antibody level was found in susceptible H III mice as compared to resistant L III mice. Mortality rates of the F 1 (H Â L) hybrids and F 2 and backcross segregants reflected co-dominance of both characters and the survivors had higher preexisting anti-MHV antibody titers. The present data show that both lines had the potential to synthesize antibodies and that the resistance acquired by the susceptible H III mice paralleled the antibody synthesis. Nevertheless, higher antibody titers were necessary to confer resistance in H III mice than in L III ones. When compared to uvMHV3, a single immunization with a related infectious MHV strain induced a higher antibody synthesis and led the H III mice to resist the MHV3 challenge. A direct correlation between the antibody level and resistance to infection was always observed in H III mice. Although mounting a Th2 response as indicated by IgG1 responses, they were also able to readily synthesize large amounts of IgG2a antibodies after immunization or during infection, reflecting a Th1 response. The transfer of anti-MHV antibodies to susceptible H III mice was capable of conferring resistance to MHV3, providing the antibodies were present before virus infection and in large amounts. The resistance and the survival time of these animals increased with the level of antibody administered. If these direct and clear data suggest that H III mice can acquire resistance through antibodies, the basis of the resistance of the resistant L III mice may rely on mechanisms less dependent on antibodies.	Besides the evidence that MHV3-neutralizing antibodies, as evaluated by in vitro assay, can be generated by related MHV-strains and are capable of conferring in vivo protection when present in a certain amount, our studies make clear the importance of the environment and genetic profile in studies of resistance and point out the advantages of approaches using genetically heterogeneous mice, which better represent a population and are closer to what is found in nature.|

Although there is growing literature on influenza transmission at national and international scales, little attention has been paid to a city scale. This article aims to understand the spatial-temporal transmission of influenza and identify its health risks in the urbanized area of Buffalo, New York. An individual-based spatially explicit model is established to replicate an urban contact network, and simulate influenza epidemics. The resulting epidemic curves and infection intensity maps are used to analyze the transmission dynamics, possible contributing factors, and high-risk places and times.	These results suggest a feasibility of identifying high-risk areas in advance based on analysis of census and land use data. These high-risk places should be set up as control targets during an epidemic wherever the initial infections are found. In addition, the results also imply that the incorporation of city-wide individual travel data into health surveillance is critical for designing proper timelines for allocating control efforts. These suggestions are particularly significant under the current circumstances in which vaccines and manpower are insufficient to combat the new wave of H1N1 influenza.|

This Vpu function is intrinsically linked to its channel-like structure, which enables it to interfere with homologous transmembrane structures in infected cells. Because Vpu interacts destructively with host background K þ channels that set the cell resting potential, we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral release by destabilizing the electric field across a budding membrane. Here, we found that the efficiency of Vpu-mediated viral release is inversely correlated with membrane potential polarization. By inhibiting the background K þ currents, Vpu dissipates the voltage constraint on viral particle discharge. As a proof of concept, we show that HIV-1 release can be accelerated by externally imposed depolarization alone. Our findings identify the trigger of Vpu-mediated release as a manifestation of the general principle of depolarization-stimulated exocytosis.	Biophysical Journal 99(6) 1718-1725|

191	24a61244c69f09bc9392bbbb4a97e881ee68dc5e	Cell Discovery Rapid detection of African swine fever virus using Cas12a-based portable paper diagnostics	African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a dsDNA virus responsible for a severe, highly contagious, and lethal disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs. ASFV has brought enormous economic loss to a number of countries, and effective vaccine and therapy are still lacking. Therefore, a rapid, sensitive, and field-deployable detection of ASFV is important for disease surveillance and control. Herein, we developed a Cas12a-mediated portable paper assay to rapidly and precisely detect ASFV. We identified a robust set of crRNAs that recognized the highly conserved region of essential ASFV genes. The Cas12a-mediated detection assay showed low tolerance for mismatch mutations, and no cross-reactivity against other common swine pathogens. We further developed a paper-based assay to allow instrument-free detection of ASFV. Specifically, we applied gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugate to engineer homemade strips and combined it with Cas12a-mediated ASFV detection. This portable paper, instrument-free diagnostics, faithfully detected ASFV in swine samples, showing comparable sensitivity to the traditionally instrumentdependent qPCR method. Taking together, we developed a highly sensitive, instant, and economic Cas12a-mediated paper diagnostics of ASFV, with a great application potential for monitoring ASFV in the field.	The gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were prepared as previously described 46 . Briefly, sodium citrate solution (1%, w/v) was added into the boiling HAuCl 4 solution (0.01%, w/v). After continuous stirring for 30 min, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature to obtain a stable colloidal gold suspension. Subsequently, the size of Au NPs was detected by dynamic light scattering. To further prepare the Au NP-antibody conjugate, NaOH solution was used to adjust the pH of Au NP suspension, and the anti-FITC antibody was added. After stirring for 1 hour at 37°C, the bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (0.1%, w/v) was added, and the Au NP-antibody conjugates were collected by centrifugation. The immunologic test strips were composed of a sample pad, a conjugate pad, an antibody pad, a NC membrane, and an adaptive backing card 46 . Briefly, the conjugate pad was dripped with appropriate amounts of Au NP-antibody conjugate suspension, and then dried for 1 hour at 37°C. The streptavidin and nonspecific capture antibody (IgG) were dripped into the NC membrane to form control and test bands. The NC membrane was dried for 1 hour at 37°C, and then was immersed in BSA solution (1%, w/v) to passivate the unbound sites, and dried for 1 hour at 37°C. The sample pad, reconcile pad, NC membrane, and absolute pad were assembled on the adaptive backing card to form complete immunochromographic test strips.|

This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short-and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring. This COVID-19 Cerebellum Task Force consensus provides some guidance on how we may approach this uncertain time and consider preparing for the new realities we face in CA patient care once this acute crisis has passed.	As physicians, healers, and teachers, we strive to follow in a long tradition of maintaining Aequanimitas (Equanimity), Sir William Osler's (1904) use of the term for maintaining an even keel, remaining steadfast and unperturbable, with clearness of judgment despite the peril, in order to promote the physical and mental well-being of our patients, trainees, and colleagues [18] . One way we can do this is by focusing on the humanity of the care of our patients while at the same time honoring our privilege to foster the academic mission. The practical manifestations of this are to continue our work with the technology of online conferences; giving permission to ourselves and our colleagues to embrace intellectual and emotional space and take a break from the constant terrible news of the pandemic, from our own involvement in the care of COVID-19 patients now or in the imminent future; and finding comfort in thinking about and discussing the topics we care about in cerebellar neurobiology and clinical neurology. Providing some sense of what we used to think of as normal and routine outside of the COVID-19 environment is academically stimulating and important for patient care and for science; it is also, at this troubled time, a balm for the caregiver.|

A good understanding of the current status and issues of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in naturally ventilated urban buildings and the association with urban microclimate is fundamental for improving their IEQ. This paper reviews past studies on (a) the microclimate in urban street canyons, (b) the potential influence of such microclimate on IEQ of nearby naturally ventilated buildings, and (c) the real-life IEQ status in these buildings. The review focuses mainly on studies conducted by on-site measurements. The microclimate in urban street canyons is characterized by low wind speed, high surface temperature difference, high pollutant concentration, and high noise level. Insufficient ventilation rates and excessive penetration of outdoor pollutants are two key risks involved in naturally ventilated urban buildings. Existing knowledge suggests that reasonable urban planning and careful building envelope design are the primary methods to ensure acceptable IEQ and maximize the utilization of natural ventilation. However, quantitative studies of both microclimate in street canyons and IEQ in buildings are still highly insufficient in many aspects, which make cross comparison and influencing factors analysis currently impossible. Based on the limitations of previous studies and the current issues of naturally ventilated urban buildings, suggestions are made for future studies to better understand and improve IEQ in naturally ventilated urban buildings.	More efforts should be made to solve related issues of combining natural ventilation with other active and/or passive cooling technologies in urban buildings.|

Abnormal repair and replication intermediates can contain large stretches of persistent single-stranded DNA, which is extremely vulnerable to DNA damaging agents and hypermutation. Since such single-stranded DNA spans only a fraction of the genome at a given instance, hypermutation in these regions leads to tightly-spaced mutation clusters. This phenomenon of hypermutation in single-stranded DNA has been documented in several experimental models as well as in cancer genomes. Recently, hypermutated single-stranded RNA viral genomes also have been documented. Moreover, indications of hypermutation in single-stranded DNA may also be found in the human germline. This review will summarize key current knowledge and the recent developments in understanding the diverse mechanisms and sources of ssDNA hypermutation.

Thus, it is pivotal to mitigate the risk of biological incidents. Recent outbreaks of emerging and deadly viruses have highlighted a global vulnerability to public health emergencies. Countries around the world and international communities need to boost preparedness, and improve surveillance systems to predict, rapidly identify, and respond to the next public health crisis [2] . These systems need to be sensitive enough to cope with the challenges of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, risks associated with advances in biotechnology, and bio-terrorism threats. Meanwhile, to address biological threats, more grants and funds should be established for the development of better antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and efficient therapies. In underdeveloped and developing countries, both biosafety-related hardware (i.e. biosafety laboratories) and technical expertise are urgently needed. International collaborations, partnerships, and communication should be enhanced. The proper and timely sharing of biosafety achievements, including infectious diseases prevention and control, AMR, genome editing, and synthetic biotechnology, will promote the capacity of all the partners to control current and future biological-related threats, guaranteeing human health. With this journal, Biosafety and Health, we have a biosafety communications platform for everyone, for anyone, and for all. Let's work together for a better world.|

Generally, the growth rate is dependent on the size of the population at that particular epoch. We have introduced an alternative time-dependent form of growth rate. This form satisfies essential conditions to represent population growth and can be an alternative form for growth models to analyze population dynamics. We have employed the generalized Richards model as a guideline to compare our results. Further, we have applied our model in the case of epidemics. To check the efficacy of our model, we have verified the 2003 SARS data. This model has estimated the final epidemic size with good accuracy. Thereafter, we intend to describe the present COVID-2019 pandemic. We have performed our analysis with data for Italy, Spain, and Germany. Following, we have tried to predict the number of COVID-19 cases and the turning point for the USA, UK, and India.	In the case of GRM, the growth rate depends on the population size, which may be misleading in the initial phase of epidemic situations, as the number of the total reported case remains very low. Whereas in our model the growth rate is a simple function of t. So rapid predictions can be made from the number of newly reported cases. Shortly, we shall intend to encounter these issues with a further modified version of our model. This simple and elegant form of growth rate equation may be widely used for studying tumor cell growth, algal growth, etc. (colors online) Plots for day vs. daily cases and cumulative cases in COVID-19 for Italy, Spain and Germany.

It reports observations on 522 patients with confirmed CoViD-19 symptomatology, compared to 40 control subjects. In brief, notable T cytopoenia was recorded by flow cytometry in the CD4+ and the CD8+ populations, which were significantly yet inversely correlated with remarkably increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. Flow cytometry established a progressive increase in the expression of programmed cell death marker-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin & mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) as patients (n=14) deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care. Here, we interpret these observations of Diao et al from our current understanding of T cell immunophysiology and immunopathology following an immune challenge in the form of sustained viral infection, as is the case in CoViD-19, with emphasis on exhausted T cells (Tex). Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes. The relevance of these interventions for the prevention and treatment of CoViD-19 is discussed. Taken together, the data of Diao et al could proffer the first glimpse of immunopathology and possible immunotherapy for patients with CoViD-19.	In short, the evidence on Tex to date lends considerable clinical relevance to the preliminary observations reported by Diao and collaborators [1] . Their data point to significant T cytopoenia in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with confirmed CoViD-19. The serum of these patients had significantly elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. Further analyses showed a progressive increase in PD-1+CD8+ and Tim-3+CD8+ subpopulation as patients deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care. Taken together, the reported profile suggests the emergence of Tex in patients with confirmed CoViD-19. If those findings were to be replicated, then it would behoove clinical research scientists to develop a diagnostic protocol for CoViD-19 that include flow cytometric assessment of CD8+CD279+, and for good measure of CD8+CD366+ subpopulations. Patients with predominantly CD8+CD279 low/medium should be entered into vigorous immunotherapeutic protocols designed to restore CD8 cytotoxic potential by blocking the PD-1/PD-1L pathway and/or the Tim3 pathways. By contrast, palliative care only should be proffered to patients with CD8+CD366 high , as Tex is likely overwhelming their cellular immune surveillance. It is unclear at this time whether is not the two identified subsets of Tex are differentially modulated by gonadal hormones that is to say whether or not estrogen or testosterone affect inter mediate stage or advanced stage Tex differentially or at all Tex that matter. Clinical and epidemiological observations to date indicate that men are more susceptible than women to covid-19. Data also show that the elderly are significantly more at risk to covid-19 than younger patient populations. It is possible therefore and exam problem that Tex exacerbate immunosenescence. It is also our contention that an AI algorithm of the type described previously will be found to be relevant in the context of CoViD-19 [2] . This is of particular importance here as it could yield clinically important benefit in the immuno-pathological diagnostics of patients afflicted with CoVid-19, and directed immunotherapeutic interventions. Case in point, the specialized AI algorithm could establish the means and protocol for the restoration of T cell homeostasis from immuno-senescence and from T cell exhaustion, which should be key in the development of new and improved immuno-therapies [14] , in particular for patients with CoViD-19.

Infancy is also a critical time for post-natal lung growth and development. Severe or repeated lower airway injury in very young children likely increases the likelihood of chronic pulmonary disorders later in life. Globally, bronchiolitis is the most common form of acute lower respiratory infections during infancy. Compared with non-Indigenous Australian infants, Indigenous infants have greater bacterial density in their upper airways and more severe bronchiolitis episodes. Our study tests the hypothesis that the anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin, improve the clinical outcomes of Indigenous Australian infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis.	In summary, given the very high burden of bronchiolitis in Indigenous infants (the age when lung growth is most critical post-natally), and the association between ALRI and future lung dysfunction, our RCT on azithromycin in Indigenous Australian infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis has the potential to have both short term gains and a long-term benefit for reducing morbidity of respiratory illness. |

202	cdce4cde09e5728aa67c6fa09f5c71fce11cf1db	REVIEW AND EXPERIMANTAL ARTICLES 530 GMYL and AGOL	Recombination is widespread among RNA viruses, but many molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. It was believed until recently that the only possible mechanism of RNA recombination is replicative template switching, with synthesis of a complementary strand starting on one viral RNA molecule and being completed on another. The newly synthesized RNA is a primary recombinant molecule in this case. Recent studies have revealed other mechanisms of replicative RNA recombination. In addition, recombination between the genomes of RNA viruses can be nonreplicative, resulting from a joining of preexisting parental molecules. Recombination is a potent tool providing for both the variation and conservation of the genome in RNA viruses. Replicative and nonreplicative mechanisms may contribute differently to each of these evolutionary processes. In the form of trans splicing, nonreplicative recombination of cell RNAs plays an important role in at least some organisms. It is conceivable that RNA recombination continues to contribute to the evolution of DNA genomes.	In addition, nonreplicative recombination between viral RNAs has another aspect, going beyond the scope of virology. It is appealing to assume that the uninfected cell also provides room for some of the processes underlying nonreplicative recombination and differing from canonical exon-intron rearrangements associated with intramolecular or intermolecular splicing. If nonspecific covalent joining of cell RNAs or their fragments does occur, then a natural step on the road is to consider the possibility of fixation of chimeric RNA sequences in chromosomal DNA via reverse transcription. In other words, it is possible to assume that some of the mechanisms of nonreplicative RNA recombination play an important role in the evolution of not only viral, but also cell genomes [51, 90] .|

We genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagSNPs from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and measles virusspecific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in Caucasians and African-Americans.	Taken together, the increasing evidence for the role of novel innate immunity genes (such as DDX58/RIG-I, OAS and ADAR), in the regulation of measles vaccine adaptive immunity will likely open new avenues for designing better vaccines and improved vaccination strategies.|

So far it has spread over 200 countries in the whole world. Mathematical modeling of an epidemic like CoVID-19 is always useful for strategic decision making, especially it is very useful to gain some understanding of the future of the epidemic in densely populous countries like India. We use a simple yet effective mathematical model SIR(D) to predict the future of the epidemic in India by using the existing data. We also estimate the effect of lock-down/social isolation via a time-dependent coefficient of the model. The model study with realistic parameters set shows that the epidemic will be at its peak around the end of June or the first week of July with almost 10 8 Indians most likely being infected if the lock-down relaxed after May 3, 2020. However, the total number of infected population will become one-third of what predicted here if we consider that people only in the red zones (approximately one-third of India's population) are susceptible to the infection. Even in a very optimistic scenario we expect that at least the infected numbers of people will be O(10 7 ).

The viral spike (S) glycoprotein is a major virulence factor for several coronavirus species, including the OC43 strain of HCoV (HCoV-OC43). In an attempt to study the role of this protein in virus spread within the central nervous system (CNS) and neurovirulence, as well as to identify amino acid residues important for such functions, we compared the sequence of the S gene found in the laboratory reference strain HCoV-OC43 ATCC VR-759 to S sequences of viruses detected in clinical isolates from the human respiratory tract. We identified one predominant mutation at amino acid 758 (from RRSR# G 758 to RRSR#R 758 ), which introduces a putative furin-like cleavage (#) site. Using a molecular cDNA infectious clone to generate a corresponding recombinant virus, we show for the first time that such point mutation in the HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein creates a functional cleavage site between the S1 and S2 portions of the S protein. While the corresponding recombinant virus retained its neuroinvasive properties, this mutation led to decreased neurovirulence while potentially modifying the mode of virus spread, likely leading to a limited dissemination within the CNS. Taken together, these results are consistent with the adaptation of HCoV-OC43 to the CNS environment, resulting from the selection of quasi-species harboring mutations that lead to amino acid changes in viral genes, like the S gene in HCoV-OC43, which may contribute to a more efficient establishment of a less pathogenic but persistent CNS infection. This adaptative mechanism could potentially be associated with human encephalitis or other neurological degenerative pathologies.

In this study, we successfully generated a recombinant LaSota candidate vaccine strain, rNDV-IBV-T/B, which expresses a short, synthetic, previously identified IBV S1 multi-epitope cassette using the reverse genetic system. The recombinant virus was propagated in nine-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 20 passages and genetic stability was confirmed by whole genome DNA sequencing. The recombinant virus had a hemagglutination (HA) titer of 2 10 , mean death time (MDT) of 118 hours, and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 0.05. None of these were significantly different from the parental Newcastle disease virus (NDV) LaSota strain (p > 0.05). Vaccination of white leghorn chickens at one day of age with 10 6 EID 50 rNDV-IBV-T/B provided 90% protection against virulent IBV M41 challenge at three weeks of age, which was significantly higher than the protection of the control group vaccinated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (p < 0.05). The ciliostasis scores of rNDV-IBV-T/B-vaccinated and LaSota-vaccinated groups were 4.2 and 37.6, respectively, which indicated that rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination reduced the pathogenicity of IBV toward the trachea. Furthermore, real-time RT-PCR assay showed that the rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination resulted in low levels of viral load (647.80 ± 49.65 RNA copies) in the trachea four days post-challenge, which is significantly lower than groups vaccinated with PBS (8591.25 ± 311.10 RNA copies) or LaSota (7742.60 ± 298.50 RNA copies) (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the same dose of rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination provided complete protection against velogenic NDV F48E9 challenge. These results demonstrate that the rNDV-IBV-T/B strain is a promising vaccine candidate to control both IB and ND simultaneously. Furthermore, epitope-based live vector vaccines provide an alternative strategy for the development of cost-effective and, broadly, cross-protective vaccines.	In summary, the findings of this study support that NDV is an outstanding vaccine vector for expressing an IBV multi-epitope protein as a bivalent vaccine against NDV and IBV. Furthermore, the rNDV-IBV-T/B provides an alternative strategy for the development of a cost-effective and extensively immune-protective vaccine for the control of variant IBV infection.|

The clinical features are similar but MERS progresses to respiratory failure much more rapidly than SARS. Although the estimated pandemic potential of MERS-CoV is lower than that of SARS-CoV, 144 the case fatality rate of MERS is much higher and likely related to older age and comorbid illness of the sporadic cases. Lots of knowledge gaps remain since the first discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012. 145 More studies are needed to understand the pathogenesis, viral kinetics, mode of disease transmission, and intermediary source of MERS-CoV to guide public health infection control measures and treatment. It is also important to watch for any emergence and mutation of other SARS-like clusters of circulating CoVs in the bat populations that may threaten human health. 146 |

This study demonstrated that the sero-type 3 reovirus strain Masked Palm Civet/China/2004 (MPC/04) could transiently activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in A549 cells at earlier time points of infection. The blockage of PI3K/Akt activation increased viral RNA synthesis and yield. The role of the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt in regulating reovirus replication was further analyzed. We found that during reovirus infection, the level of phosphorylated MDM2 (p-MDM2) was increased and the expression of p53 was reduced. In addition, the blockage of PI3K/Akt by Ly294002 or knockdown of Akt by siRNA reduced the level of p-MDM2 and increased the level of p53. Both indicated that the downstream effectors MDM2/p53 of PI3K/Akt were activated. Pre-treatment with Nutlin, which can destroy MDM2 and p53 cross-talk and increase the expression of p53 RNA and protein, dose-dependently enhanced reovirus replication. Additionally, the overexpression of p53 alone also supported reovirus replication, and knockdown of p53 significantly inhibited viral replication. This study demonstrates that PI3K/Akt/p53 activated by mammalian reovirus can serve as a pathway for inhibiting virus replication/infection, yet the precise mechanism of this process remains under further investigation.	Some studies have reported that p53 affects reoviral oncolysis. Kim et al. (2010) reported that p53 deficiency in certain cells renders them susceptible to reovirus infection and that the reovirus preferentially infects p53-deficient cancer cells compared with cells retaining the genes' normal counterparts. Pan et al. (2011) subsequently demonstrated that the reovirus yield did not significantly differ between HCT116 p53 +/+ and p53 À/À cells, but treating p53 wild-type A549 cells with Nutlin-3a enhanced reovirus-induced cell death. Our study showed that p53 promoted reovirus replication in A549 cells. Thus, the function of p53 may depend on cell type. The precise molecular mechanism by which p53 regulates reovirus replication remains to be explored further.|

The recent discoveries of diverse structural homologs of cGAS in animals and bacteria reveal that cGAS-like signaling is surprisingly ancient and widespread in biology. Together with the Vibrio cholerae protein dinucleotide cyclase in Vibrio (DncV), cGAS and DncV homologs comprise a family of cGAS/ DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) enzymes that synthesize noncanonical RNA signals including cyclic dinucleotides, cyclic trinucleotides, and linear oligonucleotides. Structural and biochemical breakthroughs provide a framework to understand how CD-NTase signaling allows cells to respond to changing environmental conditions. The CD-NTase family also includes uncharacterized human genes like MB21D2 and Mab21L1, highlighting emerging functions of cGAS-like signaling beyond innate immunity.	Nothing declared.|

In this study, we have used the fusogenic core as a scaffold to design HIV-1 fusion inhibitory proteins by linking another HR1 to the C terminus of HR1-HR2 (HR121) or additional HR2 to the N terminus of HR1-HR2 (HR212).

These suggest that these rationally designed proteins can be further developed as novel anti-HIV-1 therapeutics.	In a word, the designed proteins, HR121 and HR212 can be easily expressed and purified with the production at low cost, exhibiting typical a-helical structure.

Common antecedents include a recent viral or bacterial infection or more rarely immunization. The diagnosis is made in the clinical setting of acute onset of encephalopathy with other neurologic deficits and MRI findings of multifocal demyelination after excluding CNS infections. Commonly, ADEM has a monophasic course in 70%-80% of cases, with most children having a good recovery with high-dose intravenous steroid pulse treatment. IVIg and plasmapheresis may be considered as second-and third-line therapies. ADEM overall has a good prognosis, but 10%-40% of children may have neurocognitive dysfunction on follow-up. Relapses may occur in 10%-30% of patients in the form of multiphasic ADEM, optic neuritis, myelitis, or MS. There is need for further evaluation of biomarkers such as anti-MOG antibodies for prediction of relapses and prognosis.|
217	58415c28e701f09a41a504ed01dde812323c02e7			Given that exercise and weight management are the only hope of managing the symptoms of the disease, we are now advising people (especially women who suffer more with osteoarthritis) to exercise as often as possible as a core treatment, irrespective of age, comorbidity, pain severity or disability. However, the worldwide closure of gyms, swimming pools and parks, and the curb on the use of open spaces to promote social distancing means that patients with osteoarthritis must keep moving and exercise at home or close to home (i.e. going for a walk while maintaining social distancing) and eating healthy a healthy diet [11] and taking dietary supplements [12] , some of which have been shown to benefit people with osteoarthritis. The best advice for patients is to keep moving and realistically evaluate what exercises they can do from the comfort of their front room. There are lots of choices out there, from walking to yoga, Tai chi, Pilates and chairbased sessions. Some gyms have streaming services for fitness classes on demand. Even the old Nintendo Wii Fit balancing board gathering dust in the loft or attic may come in handy. However, it is important that exercise and a balanced diet go hand in hand. In summary, the best advice for women at this time is to stay at home, keep safe and remain healthy by exercising and eating a healthy diet.|

The underlying mechanisms of SARS are still largely undefined. Long pentraxin PTX3, a humoral mediator of innate immunity, has been reported to have anti-viral effects. We examined the role of PTX3 in Coronavirus murine hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1)-induced acute lung injury, a previously reported animal model for SARS. PTX3 deficient mice (129/SvEv/C57BL6/J) and their wild type littermates were intranasally infected MHV-1. These mice were also treated with recombinant PTX3. Effects of PTX3 on viral binding and infectivity were determined in vitro. Cytokine expression, severity of lung injury, leukocyte infiltration and inflammatory responses were examined in vivo. In PTX3wild type mice, MHV -1 induced PTX3 expression in the lung and serum in a time dependent manner. MHV-1 infection led to acute lung injury with greater severity in PTX3 deficient mice than that in wild type mice. PTX3 deficiency enhanced early infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the lung. PTX3 bound to MHV-1 and MHV-3 and reduced MHV-1 infectivity in vitro. Administration of recombinant PTX3 significantly accelerated viral clearance in the lung; attenuated MHV-1 induced lung injury, and reduced early neutrophil influx and elevation of inflammatory mediators in the lung. Results from this study indicate a protective role of PTX3 in coronaviral infectioninduced acute lung injury.	Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. |

We describe the brief details of interaction among the bats and unknown hosts, then among the peoples and the infections reservoir (seafood market). The seafood marked are considered the main source of infection when the bats and the unknown hosts (may be wild animals) leaves the infection there. The purchasing of items from the seafood market by peoples have the ability to infect either asymptomatically or symptomatically. We reduced the model with the assumptions that the seafood market has enough source of infection that can be effective to infect people. We present the mathematical results of the model and then formulate a fractional model. We consider the available infection cases for January 21, 2020, till January 28, 2020 and parameterized the model. We compute the basic reproduction number for the data is R 0 % 2:4829. The fractional model is then solved numerically by presenting many graphical results, which can be helpful for the infection minimization.	The real sadistical data were fitted to the model for the integer case q ¼ 1. We found the basic reproduction for the given data is R 0 % 2:4829. For the solution of the fractional epidemic model, we presented a numerical scheme and obtained various graphical results. The decreasing of the fractional order parameters leads to decrease the infection in the infected compartments. We believe that this model is the beginning of the disease dynamics with not enough data in hands and also the Fig. 7 The dynamics of corona virus model with various initial conditions.|

Total 78 cats without ocular and upper respiratory tract disease were examined. Specimens were obtained from ocular conjunctiva and oropharynx. Using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR, three pathogens were simultaneously detected. In examined 78 cats, 49 (63%) cats were positive for FHV-1. However, all specimens were negative for C. felis and FCV. In conclusion, many cats recovered from FHV-1 infection remain subclinical carriers in shelter environment.	This study demonstrated that many cats of an animal shelter in Korea, as well as other countries, remain latently infected with FHV-1. These cats would be sources of infection after returning to society. Thus, proper management by veterinarians, cleaning protocols, a low stress environment and proper cage design are necessary in an animal shelter. Especially, it may be important to make a less stressful environment through decreasing the extent of crowding. Although vaccination with FHV-1 and FCV cannot lead to prevention of infection and viral shedding, this may reduce the overall severity of disease [16] . Thus, it is necessary to routinely vaccinate the individual shelter cats and to keep incoming cats from infected sources such as shelters and breeding catteries.|

His past medical history included coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction 4 years previously due to marginal branch occlusion. This initial lesion was treated by stenting of the marginal branch and LAD (2.5/16 mm and 3.0/22 mm drug eluting stents; Zotarolimus/ ABT-578). Two years after the first stent implantation, neointimal proliferation required a second drug-eluting stent of the marginal branch stent (2.75/16 mm, Everolimus). The patient's risk profile comprised type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and hyperlipidaemia.	Of note, the current STEMI guidelines consider a new complete right bundle branch block as sign of acute myocardial infarction [11] . In the treatment of COVID-19 patients, ECG and echocardiography are essential for rapid diagnosis and should be available on isolation wards and intensive care units. This case emphasizes the importance of cardiac monitoring and echocardiography which is of high relevance in all COVID-19 patients with rapid progression of symptoms. Stent thrombosis is a dramatic complication of coronary stenting, presenting as sudden death or acute myocardial infarction if missed or misdiagnosed [12] . An immediate revascularization is essential in order to prevent long-term cardiac impairment or death [13] . In COVID-19 patients, this even more important than in patients without accompanying diseases.|

Its pathogenesis has not been fully unraveled because an animal model is currently lacking. Here we examined whether rhesus macaques encounter HCoV-NL63 infections during life, by examining the levels of antibodies to HCoV-NL63 in time. The animals were followed for 7 up till 19 years, and in three animals we observed a steep rise in antibodies during follow up, indicative of a natural infection with HCoV-NL63.	In the early days of human coronavirus identification (the 1960s) it was possible to experimentally infect volunteers with the viruses which were isolated from persons with common colds. Nowadays, with the recent epidemic of SARS-CoV, it is very difficult to attract volunteers for such studies. Not only has the public become aware of the potential dangers of a coronavirus infection, the recently identified viruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) have been isolated from children or adults with severe lower respiratory tract infection, and not simple common colds. Consequently, the only possibility to connect the recently identified coronaviruses to a certain disease is via associations with disease or animal experiments. To date no animal model system has been described for HCoV-NL63. Although all signs suggest that Rhesus macaques might be a good model system -since cells of Rhesus macaques can be in vitro infected by HCoV-NL63 -nobody has reported infection of these animals yet. We show here that there are clear signs that Rhesus macaques acquire natural infections with HCoV-NL63, or a serologically very closely related coronavirus. In future animal experiments to be carried out with Rhesus macaques the history of an animal should be known to determine whether the experimental infection occurs in an HCoV-NL63 naïve animal or an animal that has encountered the virus during life, as clinical symptoms might differ greatly in first or recurrent infection.|

This article reviews respiratory tract infections and pneumonia in the context of our current knowledge of the bacteria, viruses and fungi responsible for these diseases. A number of respiratory tract infections (including legionellosis and tuberculosis) can potentially be transmitted during dental treatment. Aspiration pneumonias associated with members of the oral flora are common among hospitalized, debilitated patients. In tuberculosis, there is global concern about antibiotic resistance, particularly among those strains known as XDR TB, which are virtually impossible to treat with chemotherapeutic agents. The influenza virus H5N1A is causing widespread concern, because of the potential for a pandemic if a strain develops that can transmit readily between humans. On a more positive note, improved understanding of the genetics and epidemiology of two important bacterial pathogens, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, have resulted in significant advances in prevention, through improved vaccine availability and effectiveness. Respiratory tract infections will continue to be prevalent in all human populations and provide an ongoing challenge for modern medicine.|

We then introduce a basic end-toend pipeline discussing geographic information in documents, spatial and multi-dimensional indexing [19] , and spatial retrieval and spatial filtering. After showing a range of possible applications, we conclude with suggestions for future work in the area.	"We have presented a tutorial proposal for geospatial content processing and retrieval. Geographic aspects in information access and retrieval have been increasing in relevance, given the interest in analysing huge volumes of unstructured data in fields such as the digital humanities or the computational social sciences, and given the pervasiveness of networked sensors, GPS-enabled mobile devices, and in-car navigation systems. Modern information systems need to spatially enable text to make it accessible to a variety of use cases that contain a notion of ""geographic relevance"".

228	cc4cba8699fe81e72f1b678d95dc054189e67cab	Methodology and application of Escherichia coli F4 and F18 encoding infection models in post-weaning pigs	The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) expressing F4 and F18 fimbriae are the two main pathogens associated with post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in piglets. The growing global concern regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has encouraged research into the development of nutritional and feeding strategies as well as vaccination protocols in order to counteract the PWD due to ETEC. A valid approach to researching effective strategies is to implement piglet in vivo challenge models with ETEC infection. Thus, the proper application and standardization of ETEC F4 and F18 challenge models represent an urgent priority. The current review provides an overview regarding the current piglet ETEC F4 and F18 challenge models; it highlights the key points for setting the challenge protocols and the most important indicators which should be included in research studies to verify the effectiveness of the ETEC challenge. Based on the current review, it is recommended that the setting of the model correctly assesses the choice and preconditioning of pigs, and the timing and dosage of the ETEC inoculation. Furthermore, the evaluation of the ETEC challenge response should include both clinical parameters (such as the occurrence of diarrhea, rectal temperature and bacterial fecal shedding) and biomarkers for the specific expression of ETEC F4/F18 (such as antibody production, specific F4/F18 immunoglobulins (Igs), ETEC F4/F18 fecal enumeration and analysis of the F4/F18 receptors expression in the intestinal brush borders). On the basis of the review, the piglets' response upon F4 or F18 inoculation differed in terms of the timing and intensity of the diarrhea development, on ETEC fecal shedding and in the piglets' immunological antibody response. This information was considered to be relevant to correctly define the experimental protocol, the data recording and the sample collections. Appropriate challenge settings and evaluation of the response parameters will allow future research studies to comply with the replacement, reduction and refinement (3R) approach, and to be able to evaluate the efficiency of a given feeding, nutritional or vaccination intervention in order to combat ETEC infection.	The literature review pointed out the differences in the piglets' response to F4 and F18 inoculation, especially in terms of the intensity and the timing of the diarrhea and of the piglets' immunological response and their pathogen fecal shedding. Additional research is necessary to assess the piglets' response to ETEC F18 inoculation in order to define the timing and the values of the indicators for the development of the challenge model. Table 4 summarizes the main features which need to be taken into account when designing an ETEC challenge trial, including the setting of the model and the criteria which allow a correct evaluation of the challenge effectiveness. The wide individual response variability observed among piglets to the ETEC challenge can be partially controlled by proper choice (based on genetic markers) and assessment (with the analysis of ETEC receptors) of ETEC-susceptible animals. Inclusion of pathogen-specific indicators such as specific F4 and F18 Igs, ETEC F4/F18 fecal enumeration and the in vitro ETEC adhesion test would be desirable to properly justify the effect of the specific interventions when the challenge model is applied. The above are important for the optimization of the experimental design and, in this way, take into consideration the 3R approach when using the piglet challenge model, especially concerning the issues Reduction and Refinement. |

Additionally, marrow ablation, followed by PTH treatment for three months leads to increased cortical thickness. In this study, we sought to determine whether PTH enhances bone formation after marrow ablation in aged rats. Aged rats underwent unilateral femoral marrow ablation and treatment with PTH or vehicle for four weeks. Both femurs from each rat were analyzed by X-ray and pQCT, then analyzed either by	While we had previously reported the additive effect of mechanical marrow ablation and treatment with PTH on the targeted formation of new intramedullary bone, both previous studies were performed in young adult animals and therefore left open the possibly that the formation of new bone was potentiated by the fast growth rate of young rodents [2, 3] . Here we report that rapid and abundant bone formation in response to marrow ablation and PTH treatment also occurs in nine-month old rats. Because mechanical ablation of bone marrow is followed by the rapid and transient formation of new bone in mice [17] [18] [19] [20] and rabbits (Carlson Scholz et al., unpublished data) in addition to rats, it is possible that aspiration of bone marrow at sites that are at risk for fracture, such as the hip, might lead to the transient formation of new bone in lieu of marrow in humans. It is tempting to further predict that PTH combined with marrow aspiration might promote rapid and long lasting bone formation in humans, and/or increase cortical bone density in humans, which PTH treatment alone fails to achieve [21, 22] . While the treatment of osteoporotic women with recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH ) reduces fracture risk, the gains in bone mineral density require several months during which time fractures can occur. It is our hope that future studies will address whether targeting of new bone to specific skeletal sites can be applied to humans, and can achieve efficacy in fracture prevention. In addition, deciphering the circuitry of genes regulated in response to PTH treatment following marrow ablation would help improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that initiate and promote intra membranous bone formation [23] .|

Molecular epidemiological data are limited for HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. Objectives: To identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, from 2006 to 2009. Methods: Combined nose and throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from individuals with ILI were tested for HRV using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing data of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions on RT-PCR-positive specimens were analysed. Results: Human rhinoviruses were detected by real-time PCR in 20.9% (116/555) of samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 5′UTR and VP4/VP2 on HRV-positive samples was concordant in the grouping of HRV A and B species but not HRV C species.	Samples used in this study were not collected for this study per se, but as part of a study assessing the use of face mask in controlling respiratory virus transmission in households following approval by the local institutional review board or for laboratory diagnosis of patients with an influenza-like illness. The present study does not involve the reporting of patient data, and no patient intervention occurred with the obtained results.|

It may urge health care workers to undergo certain or even large risks. According to the WHO as well as commentators, a strong case can be made for adopting a duty to treat during a disease outbreak. Many current professional codes of ethics, however, fail to provide explicit guidance sufficient to set policy or assure the public in the event of an infectious disease outbreak. This paper aims to assess whether there is a duty to treat in the case of an influenza pandemic. As we conclude that there are valid reasons that support the duty to treat in this specific context, we will subsequently explore its scope and limits.	Responsibilities that arise out of competing duties might be compensated. Care for children for example could temporarily be taken care of by others who are not needed for delivering medical care. Financial compensation could be an option. Granting doctors working under these circumstances the certainty to direct access to healthcare when needed would alleviate the fear of getting sick. By compensating these responsibilities competing duties could be overruled. Filling in how to do so is beyond the scope of this paper; this would be an interesting task for policy makers and hospital managers. Finally, the healthcare system is not just formed by doctors, but also by many supporting forces. Healthcare will not function when only licensed doctors are obliged to work and others will not show up for work. One should also consider their duty to work in the situation of an influenza pandemic.|

Patients co-infected with HIV show hepatitis B chronicity rates as much as six times higher than hepatitis B patients who are HIV seronegative.

235	4bf587d8051a33e9e8215ef96afa025a943dc1b8	The interplay between infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and the IFN system: IFN signaling is inhibited by IPNV infection	a b s t r a c t Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a major pathogen in the aquaculture industry worldwide. Factors contributing to IPNV pathogenicity are yet poorly understood. Indications of IPNV being able to evade or counteract innate host defense come from its lack of ability to induce strong type I interferon (IFN) responses in cell culture. We show here that addition of salmon rIFN-␣1 to cells prior to IPNV infection halts the viral protein synthesis and prevents processing of pVP2 into mature VP2. Furthermore, compared to pre-treatment with IFN-␣1 the antiviral state in cells infected with IPNV prior to IFN-treatment, was antagonized by IPNV, as detected by higher viral titers, faster viral protein synthesis and also by reduced Mx expression. The longer headstart the virus gets, the more prominent is the weakening of IFN signaling. IPNV VP4 and VP5 inhibit IFN-induced expression from the Mx promoter, indicating that these proteins contribute to the antagonistic effect.	Cellular proteins which activate ISGs, including proteins in the JAK/STAT pathway are prime candidates for viral inhibition. In our work treatment with type I IFN soon after infection (4 h p.i.) has a better antiviral effect than treatment at a later point (10 h p.i.). Unpublished data from our group show neither up-regulation nor a significant down-regulation of STAT1 upon IPNV infection in CHSE-214 or TO-cells. Even though STAT1 levels remain stable upon infection, it is not yet determined whether the salmon STAT1 is being activated by phosphorylation or able to relocalize into the nucleus. Nipah virus (Paramyxoviridae) V protein inhibits IFN responses by forming high-molecular-weight complexes with both STAT1 and STAT2. This result in inhibited phosphorylation and accumulation of STAT in the cytoplasm in cells expressing the Nipah virus V protein (Rodriguez et al., 2002) . Our data indicate a race between virus replication and IFN signaling and situate the antagonistic property of IPNV early in the type I IFN-signaling pathway. Further studies are clearly needed in order to identify how the IPNV proteins VP4 and VP5 and host molecules interact in the JAK/STAT pathway. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of the IFN signaling is essential, since the outcome of a viral infection, in terms of pathogenicity and persistence, is influenced by its actions on the IFN system.

236	85e682cd231ddfde0c8ecbd6642c55b5921c5366	Analysis of household data on influenza epidemic with Bayesian hierarchical model	Data used for modelling the household transmission of infectious diseases, such as influenza, have inherent multilevel structures and correlated property, which make the widely used conventional infectious disease transmission models (including the Greenwood model and the Reed-Frost model) not directly applicable within the context of a household (due to the crowded domestic condition or socioeconomic status of the household). Thus, at the household level, the effects resulting from individual-level factors, such as vaccination, may be confounded or modified in some way. We proposed the Bayesian hierarchical randomeffects (random intercepts and random slopes) model under the context of generalised linear model to capture heterogeneity and variation on the individual, generation, and household levels. It was applied to empirical surveillance data on the influenza epidemic in Taiwan. The parameters of interest were estimated by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method in conjunction with the Bayesian directed acyclic graphical models. Comparisons between models were made using the deviance information criterion. Based on the result of the random-slope Bayesian hierarchical method under the context of the Reed-Frost transmission model, the regression coefficient regarding the protective effect of vaccination varied statistically significantly from household to household. The result of such a heterogeneity was robust to the use of different prior distributions (including non-informative, sceptical, and enthusiastic ones). By integrating out the uncertainty of the parameters of the posterior distribution, the predictive distribution was computed to forecast the number of influenza cases allowing for random-household effect.

Diagnosis of an active infection with field strains of virus can be made by detecting changes in antibody titers in acute to convalescent serum samples. An acute sample should be collected as early as possible in the course of infection/disease and the convalescent sample 3 to 4 weeks later. The results of the present study demonstrate that PI-3V, BRVS, BVDV, BHV-I, and BAV-3 are commonly associated with DCP in dairy herds in Mashhad area of Khorasan Razavi province, Iran. Additionally, a recent study shows that concomitant multiple viral infections are encountered in outbreaks of DCP in dairy herds as indicated by concomitant seroconversion to more different viral agents in diseased animals. Serological evidence of one to five different a Any combination of BHV-1, BVDV, BRSV, PIV-3, and BAV-3; for definition of infected animal a For classification of infection viral agents in a herd during a DCP was observed, and infection with two or more different viruses in one diseased animal with the observed 32 rising antibodies to seroconversion viruses (BVDV, BRSV, PI-3V, and BAV-3) was proved in 22 diseased calves. This situation may be characterized by the multi-agent nature of the etiology of DCP (Autio et al. 2007 ). Multiple antibody detections in an animal may be due to the contribution of these viruses in a BRD case (Hagglund et al. 2006) ; concurrently, those antibodies might also be generated by individual virus infections caused at different time intervals. Although we detected antibodies to several viruses on each farm and even in high titers, we could only find seroconversion in 22 of 42 diseased calves on nine farms. This is probably because of the young age of the calves and existing maternal antibodies which may suppress the calves' own production of antibodies. This is in agreement with the results of a high number of decreasing antibody titers and with the conclusion of Virtala et al. (1996) , who stated that young pneumonic calves often fail to seroconvert to agents present in the respiratory tract because of suppressive maternal antibodies. Our failure to detect seroconversion might also be a consequence of missing the acute phase of the disease. This study shows that herd size is not a risk factor for BHV-1, BVDV, BRSV, PI-3V, and BAV-3 infections. It is probably due to the similar intensive management system in both groups. Therefore, it is suggested that the main problem is the spreading of viruses by adult cattle in those herds (Yeşilbağ and Güngör 2008) . The animal populations on all farms were separated, with no movement of animals into or out of each herd. Separated animal populations are less likely to be infected from other areas than are contiguous populations. However, if infection enters separated populations, it may spread rapidly because the animal density frequently is high. Consequently, in this situation, adult cattle are the reservoirs of viral infection-serving as the source of exposure to susceptible calves in nine herds. Infected animals can be identified relatively easily by using laboratory diagnostics (such as PCR) and can be removed by slaughter or quarantine (Thrusfield 2007) . Viral infections can be also reduced in these herds by increased biosecurity aimed at reducing the risk of potential transmission of infection.|

Broiler chickens were subcutaneously immunized with isotonic saline (control), Eimeria recombinant profilin alone, or profilin emulsified with QCDC at 1 and 7 days post-hatch, and orally challenged with live Eimeria acervulina at 7 days following the last immunization. Body weight gains, gut lesion scores, fecal oocyst outputs, profilin serum antibody titers, lymphocyte proliferation, and intestinal cytokine transcript levels were assessed as measures of protective immunity. Chickens immunized with profilin plus QCDC showed increased body weight gains and decreased intestinal lesion scores compared with the profilin only or control groups. However, no differences were found in fecal oocyst shedding among the three groups. Profilin serum antibody titers and antigen-induced peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation in the profilin/QCDC group were higher compared with the profilin only and control groups. Finally, while immunization with profilin alone or profilin plus QCDC uniformly increased the levels of intestinal transcripts encoding all cytokines examined (IL-1␤, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17F, and IFN-␥) compared with the control group, transcripts for IL-10 and IL-17F were further increased in the profilin/QCDC group compared with the profilin only group. In summary, this study provides the first evidence of the immunoenhancing activities of QCDC adjuvant in poultry.	In summary, the enhanced protection against experimental avian coccidiosis conferred by QCDC is a result of augmented cellular and humoral immune responses. Future studies to elucidate the molecular and cellular immune mechanisms mediated by QCDC in various avian clinical conditions will be beneficial to the commercial industry.|

In this group of patients, the diagnosis of IA can be challenging owing to the lack of specificity of symptoms, the difficulty in discriminating colonization from infection, and the lower sensitivity of microbiological and radiological tests compared with immunocompromised patients. The aim of this article is to present to clinicians a critical review on the management of IA in non-neutropenic patients.	Open Access.

Bio-tech approaches have been widely used for improved vaccines development. While many viral diseases are controlled through vaccination, many still lack safe and efficacious vaccines. Additional challenges faced by academia, industry and governments are likely to come from viruses jumping species and also from the emergence of virulent variants of established viruses due to natural mutations. Also viral ecology is changing as the respective vectors adapt to new habitats as has been shown in the recent incursion by bluetongue virus into Europe. In this paper the current vaccines for livestock, horses and birds are described in a species by species order. The new promising bio-tech approaches using reverse genetics, non-replicating viral vectors, alpha virus vectors and genetic vaccines in conjunction with better adjuvants and better ways of vaccine delivery are discussed as well.	Notwithstanding the fact that the majority of current veterinary viral vaccines are derived and still produced by conventional attenuation and/or inactivation processes in tissue culture, genetic engineering techniques have been widely used but remain to fulfil the promise of offering improved, widespread and economic alternatives. There is, however, no perfect vaccine and such a goal may never be realised since viruses are constantly mutating in order to survive and evade host's defences.|

However, gaps in our understanding of respiratory pathogen transmission and methodological heterogeneity persist. New developments have enabled progress in this domain, and one of the major turning points has been the recognition that cross-disciplinary collaborations across spheres of human and animal health, microbiology, biophysics, engineering, aerobiology, infection control, public health, occupational health, and industrial hygiene are essential. Collaborative initiatives support advances in topics such as bioaerosol behavior, dispersion models, risk assessment, risk/exposure effects, and mitigation strategies in clinical, experimental, agricultural, and other field settings. There is a need to enhance the knowledge translation for researchers, stakeholders, and private partners to support a growing network of individuals and agencies to achieve common goals to mitigate inter-and intra-species pathogen transmission via bioaerosols.

Data showing inhibition of HSV-1 and CMV replication, when GA is administered post-infection, suggest a possible secondary mechanism targeting protein and DNA synthesis. Thus, in light of the strong effect of GA on viral infection, even after the infection begins, it may potentially be used to treat acute infections (e.g. Coronavirus, EBOV, ZIKV, IAV and measles), and also topically for the successful treatment of active lesions (e.g. HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)).

This report describes a novel approach to support patient safety. Methods: An interdisciplinary children's hospital team developed a brief ED-based evaluation process called the ED Rapid Assessment of Patients Intended for Inpatient Disposition (ED RAPID). It entails a brief evaluation of vital signs and clinical stability by the ED attending physician and nurse. Children deemed stable are admitted to inpatient wards, whereas those requiring immediate intervention undergo full ED evaluation and disposition. We assessed outcomes for all children evaluated through this process from March 2013 through February 2015. Results: During the study period, we identified 715 patients undergoing ED RAPID evaluation. Of these, we directly admitted 691 (96.4%) to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation; median ED treatment time was 4.0 minutes. We transitioned 24 (3.4%) to full ED evaluation, 14 (2.0%) because a ward bed was unavailable, and 10 (1.4%) for clinical reasons identified in the evaluation. We admitted four of the 10 stopped (40% of stops, 0.6% of total) to an intensive care unit, and 6 (60% of stops, 0.8% of total) to the hospital ward after ED care. Eight children (1.1%) admitted to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation required a transfer to an intensive care unit within 12 hours. Conclusion: The ED RAPID evaluation process for children directly admitted to the hospital was feasible and effective in this setting.	We created the ED RAPID evaluation process to support the safe disposition of patients eligible for a direct hospital admission. When performed by pediatric ED attending physicians and nurses, the ED RAPID evaluation is feasible and effective, identifying a small but high-risk group of patients who required ED stabilization or diversion to the ICU; these patients were more likely to be infants and to have respiratory illnesses. Implementation of a similar pediatric direct admission process at other institutions may depend upon hospital staffing, referral patterns, resources, and patient populations, but this experience shows that it is possible in the right setting. The ED RAPID evaluation process simultaneously supports both the cost-effective, patient-centered practice of direct hospital ward admission and patient safety.|

Ten years of magnetofection-Progress and prospects ☆	Nucleic acids carry the building plans of living systems. As such, they can be exploited to make cells produce a desired protein, or to shut down the expression of endogenous genes or even to repair defective genes. Hence, nucleic acids are unique substances for research and therapy. To exploit their potential, they need to be delivered into cells which can be a challenging task in many respects. During the last decade, nanomagnetic methods for delivering and targeting nucleic acids have been developed, methods which are often referred to as magnetofection. In this review we summarize the progress and achievements in this field of research. We discuss magnetic formulations of vectors for nucleic acid delivery and their characterization, mechanisms of magnetofection, and the application of magnetofection in viral and nonviral nucleic acid delivery in cell culture and in animal models. We summarize results that have been obtained with using magnetofection in basic research and in preclinical animal models. Finally, we describe some of our recent work and end with some conclusions and perspectives.	Major progress has been made in this field during the last 10 years, reflected in an exponentially growing number of publications. Being commercially available, magnetofection has become a widely used research tool. Being applicable virtually with any type of nucleic acid and any kind of nonviral or viral gene vector, it can improve the efficacy of gene delivery in many applications. Now, that the benefits and potentials of magnetofection have been highlighted comprehensively it is time to acknowledge that the method is not a solution for any limitation in nucleic acid delivery. After many years of research, conventional forms of delivery have been advanced successfully to clinical trials. Other forms of targeting and other physical methods of delivery are highly promising. To date, side by side comparisons or combinations for example with electroporation, sonoporation, hydroporation, aerosolization, ballistic methods, occlusion of the blood outflow from the target organ or biological targeting are still rare. In the absence of further evidence, any of the named methods needs to be considered as promising as magnetofection is. Electroporation is probably the most advanced method and the efficiency of this method in vitro and in vivo, particularly with non-dividing cells, still needs to be achieved with magnetofection. When compared to all the other physical methods, the major advantage of magnetofection is that it is able to combine simplicity, non-expensiveness, localization of delivery, enhanced efficiency and reduction of incubation time and of vector doses (cited from [138] ). The true potential of the method is possibly its amenability to innovation with integrated technologies. Examples are combined magnetic cell separation and nucleic acid delivery for future cell therapies, magnetic positioning of genetically engineered cells for tissue regeneration and tissue engineering and theranostic systems for integrated nucleic acid delivery and multimodal medical imaging. There is plenty of work to be done for years to come.|

It restricts a diverse group of pathogenic, enveloped viruses, by interfering with endosomal fusion. In this report, the swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3) gene was cloned. It shares the functionally conserved CD225 domain and multiple critical amino acid residues (Y19, F74, F77, R86 and Y98) with its human ortholog, which are essential for antiviral activity. Ectopic expression of sIFITM3 significantly inhibited non-enveloped foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection in BHK-21 cells. Furthermore, sIFITM3 blocked FMDV infection at early steps in the virus life cycle by disrupting viral attachment to the host cell surface. Importantly, inoculation of 2-day-old suckling mice with a plasmid expressing sIFITM3 conferred protection against lethal challenge with FMDV. These results suggest that sIFITM3 is a promising antiviral agent and that can safeguard the host from infection with FMDV.	All authors declare no competing interests.|

Methods: One hundred and eighty-three patients diagnosed with pulmonary infections in an ER were divided into an acid fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive, active PTB group (G1 = 84) and a non-AFB smearpositive, pulmonary infection group (G2 = 99). HRCT images from a 64-Multidetector CT were analyzed, retrospectively, for the morphology, number, and segmental distribution of pulmonary lesions. Results: Utilizing multivariate analysis, five variables were found to be independent risk factors predictive of G1: (1) consolidation involving the apex segment of right upper lobe, posterior segment of the right upper lobe, or apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe; (2) consolidation involving the superior segment of the right or left lower lobe; (3) presence of a cavitary lesion; (4) presence of clusters of nodules; (5) absence of centrilobular nodules. A G1 prediction score was generated based on these 5 criteria to help differentiate G1 from G2. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96 ± 0.012 in our prediction model. With an ideal cut-off point score of 3, the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) are 90.9%, 96.4%, 90.0% and 96.8%, respectively. Conclusion: The use of this AFB smear-positive, active PTB prediction model based on 5 key HRCT findings may help ER physicians determine whether or not isolation is required while awaiting serial sputum smear results in high risk patients.	The smear-positive, active PTB prediction model based upon five characteristic HRCT findings may ease the burden of RI in areas where availability and financial resources are limited.|

This weak point was improved in the SARS project by focusing on a simple modification of everyday triage routines. Shared sentinel surveillance code sets, such as those provided by the Frontlines of Medicine, and cross-platform coding and electronic transmission standards, such as those developed for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Public Health Information Network, should permit automatic and consistent collection and transmission of sentinel surveillance markers from routinely created records such as triage logs or billing codes. 8, 9 The regional emergency medicine Internet software application provides a convenient and practical network for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of such surveillance.|

Due to the inconvenience and difficulty of preparing SEDs from some patients, producing SEDs from allogeneic blood donations is gaining popularity. A major safety concern associated with allogeneic blood is virus transmission. We therefore herein evaluated the possibility of applying a solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment to inactivate viruses and studied the impacts of such treatment of SEDs to resolve DES in a rabbit model. Sera prepared from the blood of five rabbits were pooled and divided into two subpools. One was untreated (SEDs), while the other was virally-inactivated with 1% Tri-n-butyl phosphate/1% Triton X-45 at 31°C for 1 h (S/D-SEDs). DES was induced in rabbits using 0.1% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). Rabbits were divided into five groups of two rabbits each. One group was untreated (control), three were treated twice daily for 3 weeks using PBS, SEDs, or S/D-SEDs, and the last received an additional 0.1% BAC (as the negative control). The DES condition was determined by measuring aqueous tear secretion (Schirmer's test), corneal fluorescein staining, a corneal histologic examination, TUNEL stain apoptosis, and corneal inflammatory marker (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and IL-6) expressions. We first confirmed that SEDs and S/D-SEDs had similar protein profiles and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β contents. Animal experiments showed that tear secretion did not significantly differ between the SED and S/D-SED groups but was significantly higher than in the PBS group. Eye fluorescein staining revealed dramatic improvements in epithelial defects in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs, and hematoxylin/ eosin staining revealed microscopic epithelial layers similar to those of the untreated controls. Inflammatory markers and TUNEL studies showed that healthy epithelium had been restored in groups treated with SEDs or S/D-SEDs. In conclusion, this preclinical study supports the possibility of using S/D virally inactivated SEDs to treat DES and restore a normal epithelium. 3 / 14 different treatments. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD (error bars). * p<0.05 versus control group; # p<0.05 versus DES; % p<0.05 versus PBS; @ p<0.05 versus SED (One way ANOVA-Tukey's multiple comparisons).	In conclusion, our data support the possibility of performing pathogen inactivation treatment of SEDs using S/D treatment. These data, which should be confirmed using human SEDs, open perspectives for the development of standardized pooled allogeneic SEDs.|
254	16a28a8a87866ad16d935338c02a95251cb0e85c	Putative structure and function of ORF3 in SARS coronavirus	Based on molecular modeling techniques we constructed a rational 3D model of ORF3 in SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Our studies suggest that the function of ORF3 could be involved in FAD/NAD binding according to its predicted structure and comparison with other structure neighbors. Furthermore, we identified three pairs of non-canonical N-H/p interactions in the structure of ORF3, which can make contributions to the stability of protein structure. These results provide important clues for better understanding of SARS-CoV ORF3 and trying new therapeutic strategies. q	In order to collect as many evidence as possible for such a speculation, we employed VAST, DALI and CE to search the structure neighbors of ORF3. We found that the top hits, except the above templates, focus on the following dehydrogenases (also belong to the FAD/NAD-linked reductase family): 1OJT (lipoamide dehydrogenase from bacterium Neisseria meningitides), 1JEH (lipoamide dehydrogenase from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae), 1LPF (lipoamide dehydrogenase from bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens), 1EBD (dehydrolipoamide dehydrogenase from bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus), and 1DXL (lipoamide dehydrogenase from pea Pisum sativum). The superpositions between these enzymes and ORF3 are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen from the revised structure alignment (Fig. 3 ) that there are a number of similar structural patterns showing conservative residues (bold representation). In particular, among them are partially conserved FAD-bind motif (marked as '#') and NAD-binding motif (marked as '$') [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . This suggests that there could be a link between ORF3 and FAD/NAD-binding protein indeed. Finally, the non-canonical interactions in ORF3 protein structure were identified by NCI program and the results showed that there are three pairs of main chain-side chain interactions: Tyr160 (donor) and Phe43 (acceptor), Phe43 (donor) and Tyr206 (acceptor), and Ile232 (donor) and Phe231 (acceptor). Among these interactions, Phe43 forms two N-H/p bonds in a sandwich fashion: one donates to Tyr206, and one donated by Tyr160, as existed in human rac1 [15] and SARS-CoV main protease [16] . These noncanonical bindings fix the big helix Phe43 locate to the two loops Tyr160 and Tyr206 locate, hence stabilizes the structure of ORF3 protein (Fig. 4) . These results can be used for rational design of mutagenesis experiments and analysis of conservation of interactions at functional sites. In recent years, the non-canonical interactions have been shown to be important for the stability of protein structure [17] [18] [19] and ligand recognition [20] . |
255	406a5f9abeca2c50c3da8ce988fadc4a3ab5a619			Through the PEPFAR and other global health programs, the USA is the largest founder and the major player in the global AIDS, TB, and malaria treatment programs covering African and other developing countries. Most of the ARV drugs used in these US founded programs are actually generic drugs manufactured in developing countries, mostly in India. Additionally, the big pharmaceutical companies in the developed countries developed all of the ARV drugs and most of the anti-TB and malaria drugs. Some of the drugs were developed by developing countries, such as artemisinin, which was invented by the Chinese scientists. Without the close collaborations in the last decade between the south and the north and the private and public, the lives of several millions of HIV/AIDS patients, TB patients, and malaria patients would not have been saved. Therefore, developed countries and big pharmaceutical companies must ally with the developing countries in the war against AIDS, TB, malaria, and other infectious diseases. Due to the lack of such collaboration, the initial sparks of HIV infections in central Africa become a global AIDS pandemic killing 30 million lives in both the developing and developed world. Such tragedy can only be prevented through further strengthening collaboration between the private and public sectors in both developed and developing countries.|

The CBT strategies outlined in the text and illustrated by numerous case examples, sample dialogue, reproducible handouts and assessment questionnaires make this text an invaluable resource for practicing clinicians and students alike. Throughout the text, the authors stress the importance of establishing a trusting relationship with health anxious clients who often feel abandoned or insulted by the health care profession. Typically, these individuals have worn out their welcome with health care practitioners by the time they are referred to a psychologist they tend to approach psychological intervention with skepticism if not acrimony, especially if they feel that their bodily symptoms health concerns are being dismissed as ""all in their head."" Taylor and Asmundson stress the importance of the psychologist establishing and maintaining good communication with the primary-care physician, as well as the client's partner and other family members who may be enlisted to assist in treatment (e.g., in ceasing repeated reassurance provision). The authors are to be commended for producing a text that seems destined to become a ""must read"" for professionals interested in understanding and treating health anxiety disorders.|"
263	eab2335a78df277e8136f61275b17a3f50d33d54	Regulation of Stress Granules and P-Bodies During RNA Virus Infection	RNA granules are structures within cells that play major roles in gene expression and homeostasis. Two principle kinds of RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals: stress granules (SGs), which contain stalled translation initiation complexes, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are enriched with factors involved in RNA turnover. Since RNA granules are associated with silenced transcripts, viruses subvert RNA granule function for replicative advantages. This review, focusing on RNA viruses, discusses mechanisms that manipulate stress granules and P-bodies to promote synthesis of viral proteins. Three main themes have emerged for how viruses manipulate RNA granules; i) cleavage of key host factors, ii) control of PKR activation and iii) redirecting RNA granule components for new or parallel roles in viral reproduction, at the same time disrupting RNA granules. Viruses utilize one or more of these routes to achieve robust and productive infection.	Finally, the emerging concept that SG formation signals downstream stress signals that activate innate antiviral mechanisms as part of an integrated stress response should receive more attention. As stress responses and innate immunity likely crosstalk at multiple levels, it is possible that aspects of RNA granule biology could be exploited in the future as a broad spectrum antiviral strategy. Stress granule assembly and interference by RNA viruses modulating PKR. Virus infection causes stress at multiple levels that reduces host translation through activation of eIF2 kinases, principally PKR, cleavage or inactivation of other initiation factors or other mechanisms. These translation insults convert active polysome mRNPs into stalled translation initiation complex mRNPs containing 40S ribosome subunits, initiation factors and mRNAs. A complex series of events (not depicted) involving nucleation of multiple stress granule proteins such as G3BP1, Tia-1/TIAR, TDRD3, FUS, TDP43 and HDAC6 plus transport of mRNP complexes on microtubules leads to aggregates of translation initiation complex mRNPs in stress granules. Reovirus and rotavirus can repress SGs, but mechanisms are not known. Note that many viruses control PKR activation; only those discussed in the text are indicated. Also note that stress granule triggers by virus infection may operate at other levels and feed into this scheme. Virus blockade and co-opting of stress granule responses. Specific points/proteins where viruses interact with and inhibit or divert the RNA granule assembly pathway are shown. Poliovirus 3C proteinase cleaves the critical SG nucleating protein G3BP1. Several viruses co-opt G3BP and divert it into novel virus induced foci. HCV diverts G3BP1 into replication/assembly complexes together with HCV core, ns5A and ns5B proteins that also associate with lipid droplets. HCV complexes also contain many P-body components detailed in Fig 3. Flaviviruses divert G3BP1 (with USP10 and caprin1) and TIA1/TIAR to replication complexes by binding the host proteins on virus RNAs. Alphaviruses recruit G3BP1 into viral replication complexes via direct interaction viral protein nsP3. Junin virus (possibly N and G proteins) recruits G3BP1 into replication complexes that also contain translation factors eIF4G and eIF4A. Pathways of P-body disruption by viruses. P-bodies form via a complex series of events involving remodeling mRNPs by stripping of initiation factors and ribosome subunits, association with GW182, undergoing Pan2/3-mediated deadenylation, microtubule transport, and association with other RNA decay factors (e.g., Xrn1, Dcp1a, DDX6 (Rck/ p54), GW182 and Lsm components of the exosome), and final concentration in P-bodies. The order of association of factors with mRNPs in PBs is arbitrary. HCV subverts many PB components into novel viral replication/assembly foci with viral core protein that also contain some SG components (e.g. G3BP, Fig. 2 ). Flaviviruses also divert PB factors into replication foci, likely bound with viral RNA through interaction with DDX6(Rck/p54). Poliovirus induces cleavage of Dcp1a and rapid degradation of Xrn1 and Pan3. Rap55 is a critical PB factor that IAV protein NS1 diverts from normal association with PBs. Bunyavirus Junin virus incorporates viral N protein into PBs to interfere with cellular Dcp1a/2 decapping function and facilitate viral cap-snatching.|

265	cd8bfda4284af708fa290e425b76e5332a5cecb8	Microglia have a protective role in viral encephalitis-induced seizure development and hippocampal damage	In the central nervous system (CNS), innate immune surveillance is mainly coordinated by microglia. These CNS resident myeloid cells are assumed to help orchestrate the immune response against infections of the brain. However, their specific role in this process and their interactions with CNS infiltrating immune cells, such as blood-borne monocytes and T cells are only incompletely understood. The recent development of PLX5622, a specific inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor that depletes microglia, allows studying the role of microglia in conditions of brain injury such as viral encephalitis, the most common form of brain infection. Here we used this inhibitor in a model of viral infection-induced epilepsy, in which C57BL/6 mice are infected by a picornavirus (Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus) and display seizures and hippocampal damage. Our results show that microglia are required early after infection to limit virus distribution and persistence, most likely by modulating T cell activation. Microglia depletion accelerated the occurrence of seizures, exacerbated hippocampal damage, and led to neurodegeneration in the spinal cord, which is normally not observed in this mouse strain. This study enhances our understanding of the role of microglia in viral encephalitis and adds to the concept of microglia-T cell crosstalk.	Overall, based on the present data, the following scenario can be postulated. Depletion of microglia reduces the local immune response to infection, resulting in increased virus proliferation. Enhanced induction of Tregs in hippocampus and spinal cord and resulting IL-10 release seem to add to the reduced immune response to viral infection observed after microglia depletion. On the other hand, markedly Fig. 12 . TNFα, IL-6, and IFNγ mRNA expression in brain and spinal cord of infected mice. Data are shown as boxplots with whiskers from minimum to maximal values; the horizontal line in the boxes represents the median value. Note that y-axis has a logarithmic scale. In addition, individual data are shown. Sample size is 5 for noninfected mice and 6 for infected mice. Significant differences to mock-infected mice are indicated by asterisks ( * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01) while significant differences between infected mice treated with PLX5622 and infected controls are indicated by the hash sign ( # P < 0.05; ## P < 0.01). increased IL-6, and, in the spinal cord, IFNγ levels contribute to neurodegeneration and elevated seizure susceptibility. Also, the increased astrogliosis observed in infected, microglia-depleted mice may contribute to neuroinflammation and related processes, although a neurotoxic subtype (A1) of astrocytes, which is induced by neuroinflammatory microglia (Liddelow et al., 2017) , should be reduced or absent in microglia-depleted mice. Our results demonstrate a critical role for microglia in the context of viral encephalitis, affecting virus replication and innate and adaptive immune responses as well as disease progression and severity. However, as indicated by the significant differences in response to microglia depletion between the study of Wheeler et al. (2018) with a coronavirus (MHV) and the present study with a picornavirus (TMEV), both performed in B6 mice, the role of microglia in viral encephalitis markedly depends on the specific virus inducing the disease. Furthermore, the severity of viral encephalitis certainly has an impact on specific microglia response. The present findings enhance our understanding of microglia-T cell crosstalk that seems to play a vital role in neuroinflammation, whether through soluble mediators or via contact-dependent interactions (Schetters et al., 2017) .|

The virus 16 rapidly spread globally, resulting in a public-health crisis including more than one million cases 17 and tens of thousands of deaths. Here, we describe the identification and evaluation of 18 commercially available reagents and assays for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 19 infected formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) cell pellets. We identified a suitable rabbit 20 polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV spike protein antibody and a mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV 21 nucleocapsid protein (NP) antibody for cross detection of the respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins 22 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Next, we established 23 RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Furthermore, we established 24 a multiplex fluorescence ISH (mFISH) to detect positive-sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA and negative-25 sense SARS-CoV-2 RNA (a replicative intermediate indicating viral replication). Finally, we 26 developed a dual staining assay using IHC and ISH to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigen and RNA in 27 the same FFPE section.

268	1218f278a4f8d83dac14b23c8f698062812ef9d5	Potential impact of seasonal forcing on a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic	A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing more than 80,000 confirmed infections and 2,700 fatalities (as of Feb 27, 2020). Imported cases and transmission clusters of various sizes have been reported globally suggesting a pandemic is likely. Here, we explore how seasonal variation in transmissibility could modulate a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) and we parameterize our model for SARS-CoV-2 using these data. The model allows for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a small peak in early 2020 in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a larger peak in winter 2020/2021. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

269	70da3ee5739197acb1879c1d23606681aaac2e1c	A balanced game: chicken macrophage response to ALV-J infection	Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) infection can cause tumors and immunosuppression in infected chickens. Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes' function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 downregulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3α, IL-1β, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.	and EX-FABP significantly changed expression at 3 hpi and 36 hpi (Table 2 ). We also found that overexpression of IL4I1 and EX-FABP could enhance ALV-J replication in chicken MDM at 3 hpi (Figure 8 ). IL4I1 is an immunosuppressive enzyme and primarily expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells and it inhibits T-cell proliferation and activation [60, 61] . COX-2 is one of the important mediators of inflammation in response to viral infection, which contributes to viral replication and this has been shown for HCV [62] , HBV [63] , dengue virus [64] and cytomegalovirus [65] . The EX-FABP gene encodes an extracellular fatty acid binding protein and it is significantly induced by Salmonella enteritidis infections in chickens [66] . This protein may provide fatty acids for mitochondrial respiration during infection. EX-FABP expression is enhanced after treatments with inflammatory stimuli and is repressed by anti-inflammatory agents, behaving as an acute phase and constitutively expressed survival protein [67] . EX-FABP was robustly induced in ALV-J-infected MDM at 36 hpi and therefore may provide protection for MDM after the chemokine and cytokine production induced by ALV-J at 3 hpi. There is a rule that the virus is lost when the cells die. Consequently, induction of EX-FABP at 36 hpi may be a strategy of ALV-J to live in harmony with chicken macrophages at the late stages of infection. Consequently, EX-FABP, IL4I1 and COX-2 together with NFKBIA, TNFAIP3, CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 enable ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. |

271	fb773634dcd17957e12be78e5c33ba753d82d3f5	Role of Glutathionylation in Infection and Inflammation	Glutathionylation, that is, the formation of mixed disulfides between protein cysteines and glutathione (GSH) cysteines, is a reversible post-translational modification catalyzed by different cellular oxidoreductases, by which the redox state of the cell modulates protein function. So far, most studies on the identification of glutathionylated proteins have focused on cellular proteins, including proteins involved in host response to infection, but there is a growing number of reports showing that microbial proteins also undergo glutathionylation, with modification of their characteristics and functions. In the present review, we highlight the signaling role of GSH through glutathionylation, particularly focusing on microbial (viral and bacterial) glutathionylated proteins (GSSPs) and host GSSPs involved in the immune/inflammatory response to infection; moreover, we discuss the biological role of the process in microbial infections and related host responses.

Therefore, the number of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is expected to increase. A working group has been formed to provide telephone consultation services for cases with severe respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 in Japan. During the first 13 days of the service, there were 12 consultations. For each consultation, we advised the patient on the initiation of ECMO and arranged transportation for patients with ECMO. Based on experience from the H1N1 influenza pandemic, transporting patients to experienced facilities is essential to obtain better outcomes.

These bioactive compounds are economically important as drugs (pharmaceuticals), flavors, perfumes (fragrances), pigments (dyes), agrochemicals as well as cosmetics, food additives, etc. Different strategies, e.g., genetic transformation of plants with Agrobacterium rhizogenes, hairy roots and others can be applied for the improvement of production of bioactive compounds of secondary metabolic origin. Recombinant DNA techniques can be used to manipulate metabolic pathways and produce protein pharmaceuticals such as antibodies, and protein hormones. Bioinformatics and genomics can find application in drug discovery from plant-based products and biotechnological procedures can enhance and advance the studies of medicinal plants. Molecular biotechnology uses laboratory techniques to study and modify nucleic acids and proteins for applications in areas such as human and animal health, agriculture, and the environment. Herbal extracts are now widely used in the management of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, etc., as a part of CAM therapy. Plant-derived immune stimulators diverse small or large molecules (saponins, tomatine, inulin, polysaccharides), fungal b-glucans, complex molecules from marine sponge (a-galactosylceramide), shrimp chitin (chitosan), etc., have established adjuvant activity. Immunotherapy may be activation immunotherapy or suppression immunotherapy. Vaccines provide immune protection against diseases and plant-based edible vaccine production mainly involves the integration of transgene into the plant cells to produce the antigen protein for specific disease.	The in-out strategy has been tested using the HGPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene. The gene was targetted into a mouse embryonic stein cell line; subsequently, it has been successfully used with some other genes. This procedure is ideal for gene therapy. Gene targeting is the strategy of choice for gene therapy for the following reasons. (i) The targetted gene is changed in a precise and specific manner. (ii) The introduced functional gene is placed in the same context, i.e., it is flanked by the same DNA sequences, as the replaced endogenous gene. And, (iii) no other gene of the genome is affected. The major limitation of the approach is the low frequency of homologous recombination; this problem, however, is being removed by refinements of the technique. The feasibility of gene targeting has been demonstrated in a number of different cell types for several different genes. It is expected that targetted therapy would become feasibility for many genetic diseases in the near future.|

Diagnosis usually relies on antibody screening by point-of-care tests (POCT), e.g., by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and confirmation using Western blot (WB). We increasingly observed ELISA-negative, WB-positive samples and aimed to substantiate these observations using 1194 serum/plasma samples collected from 1998 to 2019 primarily from FIV-suspect cats. While 441 samples tested positive and 375 tested negative by ELISA and WB, 81 samples had discordant results: 70 were false ELISA-negative (WB-positive) and 11 were false ELISA-positive (WB-negative); 297 ambiguous results were not analyzed further. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA (82% and 91%, respectively) were lower than those reported in 1995 (98% and 97%, respectively). The diagnostic efficiency was reduced from 97% to 86%. False ELISA-negative samples originated mainly (54%) from Switzerland (1995: 0%). Sixty-four false ELISA-negative samples were available for POCT (SNAP TM /WITNESS R ): five were POCT-positive. FIV RT-PCR was positive for two of these samples and was weakly positive for two ELISA-and POCT-negative samples. Low viral loads prohibited sequencing. Our results suggest that FIV diagnosis has become more challenging, probably due to increasing travel by cats and the introduction of new FIV isolates not recognized by screening assays.	In conclusion, FIV screening solely relying on antibodies directed against a single TM protein seems to be no longer adequate in geographic areas where cats with imported and new viruses must be expected. However, a POCT (SNAP TM FIV/FeLV Combo) using additional FIV antigens besides the immunodominant TM antigen did not recognize all the presumptively FIV-positive cats. Since ELISA and POCT are used for screening purposes, the inability to recognize an increasing number of FIV-infected cats poses a serious problem. Currently, it is recommended to confirm any ELISA and POCT ambiguous or positive results in countries with a low FIV prevalence, since the positive predictive value of a positive ELISA and POCT result is low under these circumstances [56, 76, 78] . However, in light of our results, we now additionally recommend that any cat with a high suspicion of FIV infection and a negative FIV screening test be further investigated using WB for the purposes of confirmation to exclude false-negative results. Future prospective studies should aim to characterize in-depth fresh samples from cats with discordant results to identify the underlying viruses to further improve the laboratory diagnosis of FIV infection. |

In summary, we characterized eight ORF3 genes in TGEV field strains from China. We also provided novel evidence for the existence of Miller cluster TGEV field strains in Chinese pig populations, indicating the complexity of TGEV field strains in China. Interestingly, we also identify a novel deletion in within ORF3a in three field strains of TGEV, similar to the deletion found in PRCV, thus reflecting the relationship between the TGEV and PRCV. The detected-ORF3a deletion in the CH-LNCT, CH-MZL, and CH-SH strains provides the basis for further evaluation pathogenicity and replication of TGEV, and further studies are needed to determine the role of TGEV ORF3a-deletion field strains in porcine diarrhoea using an animal model.

Recent technological breakthroughs have facilitated reliable identification of host factors required for viral infections and better characterization of the virus-host interplay. While these studies have revealed cellular machineries that are uniquely required by individual viruses, accumulating data also indicate the presence of broadly required mechanisms. Among these overlapping cellular functions are components of intracellular membrane trafficking pathways. Here, we review recent discoveries focused on how viruses exploit intracellular membrane trafficking pathways to promote various stages of their life cycle, with an emphasis on cellular factors that are usurped by a broad range of viruses. We describe broadly required components of the endocytic and secretory pathways, the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport pathway, and the autophagy pathway. Identification of such overlapping host functions offers new opportunities to develop broad-spectrum host-targeted antiviral strategies.	Important insights into virus interactions with host intracellular membrane trafficking pathways have been provided over the last decade via the establishment of novel transformative omics technologies and advanced imaging tools. Nevertheless, our understanding of the virus-host interplay is far from complete and many important questions remain unanswered. For example, it remains incompletely characterized which host factors mediate the membrane alterations required for the formation of viral replication factories of RNA viruses and how they coordinate with viral proteins to facilitate this process. Further utilization of cryo-electron tomography modalities, as recently described for the study of RNA replication compartments of the non-human flock house nodavirus [256] , may help to address these questions. Also incompletely characterized are the mechanisms by which RNA viral particles are differentially directed to specific cell membrane sites for cell-to-cell vs. cell-free spread. Although certain host factors appear to maintain at least some of their distinct sorting properties in non-polarized cell culture models, to address this question, it will be important to utilize more biologically relevant polarized cell models that support authentic apical and basolateral sorting events. Three-dimensional polarized cellular systems, as the one recently developed for studying HCV entry in polarized hepatoma organoids [257] , may help to address this gap in knowledge. Improved bioinformatics approaches, largescale data analysis tools and comparative omics approaches are also required to facilitate a more effective delivery of broadly required host targets with high confidence. Further mechanistic studies are required to better understand the precise roles of the discovered, broadly required host factors in viral infections and their mode of interactions with viruses. These efforts will continue to provide insight into the workings and regulation of cellular transport machinery in cell biology and viral infections, and will advance the discovery of druggable host targets and the development of host-targeted antiviral approaches. |

Three trans-membrane non-structural proteins, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication complex. Nsp4 is localized to the ER membrane when expressed alone but is recruited into the replication complex in infected cells. It is revealed to contain four trans-membrane regions and its N-and C-termini are exposed to the cytosol.	The structure of nsp4C was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method from a Se-Met derivative crystal. Three out of the four expected selenium atoms in one molecule were located and initial phases were calculated by the program SOLVE [43] . After density modification (solvent flipping) using the program RESOLVE, a clearly interpretable electron density map was calculated. The model of nsp4C was then manually built and refined using the programs O [44] and CNS [45] . The crystal structure was refined at 2.0 Å resolution to a final R work of 22.1% and R free of 26.4%. The structure of the C425S mutant was solved by molecular replacement (MR). A model was obtained with the program PHASER from the CCP4 package [46], then further refined and rebuilt with CNS and O respectively. The crystal structure of the C425S mutant was refined at 2.4 Å resolution to a final R work of 22.7% and R free of 26.6%. Refinement statistics are detailed in Table 1 . |

The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus that has been named the SARS-associated coronavirus. It appears to be spread primarily by large droplet transmission. There is no specific therapy, and management consists of supportive care. This article summarizes currently available information regarding the epidemiology, clinical features, ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CT = computed tomography; HCWs = health care workers; RT-PCR = reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV = SARS coronavirus.	The resurgence of cases in Toronto in early May 2003 shows the difficulty of maintaining control over a new disease characterized by many puzzling epidemiological and clinical features. The continued alertness of Singapore, which most recently broke the chain of SARS transmission, shows the importance of maintaining a high level of vigilance and preparedness to ensure that a single imported case does not reignite an outbreak. Currently, control depends on prompt detection and isolation of cases, good infection control in hospitals, and the tracing and quarantine of contacts. |

First, cardiac magnetic resonance and myocardial biopsy were unavailable in this clinical setting to confirm myocardial injury and myocarditis. The exclusion of potential myocardial inflammation and injury caused by COVID-19 requires more evidence from the demonstration of pathophysiological mechanisms. Second, we have followed up the patients for over two months, however 61 patients (54.5%) are still hospitalized and the median time (from onset to the end of follow-up) of these patients were 46 days (IQR: 39.5-49.0; range: 24-66 days). Thus, the relationship between the study parameters and clinical outcomes remains to be further validated. Third, echocardiography, ECG and all the laboratory tests were based on clinical demand. Differences in the timing of the examinations and tests may lead to differences in the results. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f |

However, pure manual segmentation of CT images faces a serious challenge with the increase of suspected cases, resulting in urgent requirements for accurate and automatic segmentation of COVID-19 infections. Unfortunately, since the imaging characteristics of the COVID-19 infection are diverse and similar to the backgrounds, existing medical image segmentation methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance. Methods: In this work, we try to establish a new deep convolutional neural network tailored for segmenting the chest CT images with COVID-19 infections. We firstly maintain a large and new chest CT image dataset consisting of 21,658 annotated chest CT images from 861 patients with confirmed COVID-19. Inspired by the observation that the boundary of the infected lung can be enhanced by adjusting the global intensity, in the proposed deep CNN, we introduce a feature variation block which adaptively adjusts the global properties of the features for segmenting COVID-19 infection. The proposed FV block can enhance the capability of feature representation effectively and adaptively for diverse cases. We fuse features at different scales by proposing Progressive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling to handle the sophisticated infection areas with diverse appearance and shapes. Results: The proposed method achieves the stateof-the-art performance. Dice similarity coefficients are 0.987 and 0.726 for lung and COVID-19 segmentation, respectively. Conclusion: We conducted experiments on the data collected in China and Germany and show that the proposed deep CNN can produce impressive performance effectively. Significance: The proposed network enhances the segmentation ability of the COVID-19 infection, makes the connection with other techniques and contributes to the development of remedying COVID-19 infection.	In this paper, we designed and evaluated a three-dimensional deep learning model, called COVID-SegNet, for segmenting lung and COVID-19 from chest CT images. Inspired by contrast enhancement methods and ASPP, the proposed network includes feature variation and progressive ASPP blocks, which are beneficial to highlight the boundary and position of COVID-19 infections. These results demonstrate that the convolutional network based deep learning technology has the ability to segment COVID-19 from CT images. We were able to collect a large number of CT images from 5 hospitals, which included 861 patients with confirmed COVID-19. More importantly, we manually annotated these data by senior annotators. These contributions prove the prospect of improving diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19. In the future, we will extend the number of CT images form patients through multi-center collaborations.|
282	2116836ce185f9ba072d01c16bd0282147b37903	Thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic study on pyrolysis of representative medical waste composition	To obtain detailed information on the pyrolysis characteristics, a thermogravimetric study on the pyrolysis of 14 typical medical waste compositions was carried out in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) equipment using dynamic techniques in a stream of N 2 . An index representing pyrolysis reactivity of waste was presented. Kinetic parameters were obtained by Coats-Redfern method and used to model the TG curve. The results showed that: (a) Plastic, protein, cellulosic material, synthetic fibre, and rubber entered pyrolysis process in succession. (b) There was one decomposition stage in the pyrolysis of one-off medical glove, operating glove, cellulosic waste, absorbable catgut suture and adhesive plaster, while other components had two obvious weight loss stages. (c) The obtained apparent activation energy for second stage pyrolysis was comparably higher than that for first stage. (d) Each stage was controlled by only one kinetic mechanism, in which kinetic parameters were constant. (e) The degradation kinetics of medical waste may be affected by special physical and chemical treatment in the product manufacturing process. (f) Among 13 waste samples, the pyrolysis index of cellulosic matter was the highest, which indicated cellulosic matter had strong pyrolysis reactivity. (g) With increasing heating rate, TG curve and DTG peak shifted to high temperatures and main reaction interval of the sample became longer.	1. Because characteristic physical and chemical composition of medical waste compositions play a fundamental role in pyrolytic behavior, many of them show one major weight loss stage, but others appear in two stair-stepping stages. The activation energy of secondary stage pyrolysis is quite higher than that of the first stage and that of only one stage. 2. The maximum of rate of weight loss highly centralizes within 310-450°C. 3. The weight loss of the absolute majority of test samples is up to 95% at 800°C, which proves that the pyrolysis technology can remarkably reduce the mass of waste. 4. When the heating rate increases, the TG curve and DTG peak shift to high temperatures and the main reaction interval of the sample becomes longer. 5. It is advisable that assuming that every stage pyrolysis of medical waste components was only controlled by one major reaction mechanism; the kinetic parameters in this stage were invariable with temperature increasing. 6. It is observed that, roughly, the results show a comparatively good agreement between calculated and experimental curves, proving that the model of single reaction mechanism dominating each decomposition stage is adoptable. 7. From the comparison with kinetic parameters obtained by other authors, some results are very close, others show an acceptable dispersion. Differences can be attrib-uted to the effect of experimental conditions, to the kinetic model used, and especially to the special physical and chemical treatment of medical wastes in the manufacturing process for meeting medical application.|

Exposure to this powerful oxidizing agent can cause or exacerbate many lung conditions, especially those involving innate immunity. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A) plays many roles in innate immunity by participating directly in host defense as it exerts opsonin function, or indirectly via its ability to regulate alveolar macrophages and other innate immune cells.

286	e302107d1e121ba1d369e6c2e1fc554fc52fa0f0			Thiamine is essential in carbohydrate, amino acid and fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, comprising an essential component of transketolase and 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. 4 Thiamine is destroyed by heat, sulphur preservatives and in diets with high thiaminase activity, such as raw fish. Thiamine deficiency results in a progressive encephalopathy in both humans and animals, with the particular vulnerability of the brain due to its reliance on metabolic pathways requiring thiamine for energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. 5 Thiamine deficiency is a well-recognised entity in carnivores. Cases of naturally occurring or experimentally produced thiamine deficiency have been described in cats, 2,6,7 dogs, 1,8e10 mink, 11 and foxes. 12 The neurological signs of thiamine deficiency in cats vary, and may include impaired vision, mydriasis, ataxia, vestibular signs and seizures. These signs are often preceded by anorexia and vomiting. 2,7 Thiamine deficiency has been described in cats in connection with a variety of diets: meat preserved with sulphur dioxide, 13 commercial food, 2 or fish containing thiaminase. 6 In this report, the cat had been fed exclusively on a diet of cooked chicken, milk and salmon that was either cooked or smoked. It is likely that the thiamine deficiency in this case was caused by the cooking process degrading the thiamine, rather than due to high thiaminase levels within the diet as thiaminase is destroyed by cooking and it has been reported that smoked salmon does not contain thiaminase. 14 The diagnosis of thiamine deficiency in carnivores may be suspected on the basis of the history (in particular diet) and clinical presentation, but absolute confirmation is technically difficult and relies on the demonstration of reduced transketolase activity in red blood cells, or other indirect methods including urinary organic acid analysis and dietary analysis. 1, 2, 15 Several mechanisms have been implicated in pathogenesis of selective neuronal loss in thiamine deficiency, including impaired cerebral energy metabolism, lactic acidosis or the release of glutamate. 16 The pathological features of thiamine deficiency in cats have been described and are characterised by symmetrical petechial haemorrhages located in the caudal colliculi, lateral geniculate bodies, medial vestibular, oculomotor, red and habenular nuclei and periaqueductal grey matter. Histopathological features are characterised by haemorrhages, neutrophil oedema, neuronal degeneration, gliosis and prominent capillaries with oedematous endothelial cells. 3, 6, 7, 13 This selective vulnerability of consistent grey matter regions of the brain evident on neuropathology has previously also been demonstrated by MR imaging in both the dog and cat and this can be a useful aid in the diagnosis. 1, 2 This report highlights the value of MR imaging in the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency, with additional confirmation of the diagnosis through resolution of the MR abnormalities occurring rapidly in response to appropriate therapy. If MR imaging is planned in a case of suspected thiamine deficiency it is important to recognise that the MR imaging features of thiamine deficiency will resolve relatively quickly following supplementation with thiamine and MR imaging, therefore, cannot be relied upon to make a retrospective diagnosis of thiamine deficiency once treatment has been started and clinical improvement has occurred.|

289	ff218f343fbca258501ba42368ecbb57660e5a8f	An Analogue of the Antibiotic Teicoplanin Prevents Flavivirus Entry In Vitro	There is an urgent need for potent inhibitors of dengue virus (DENV) replication for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of infections with this virus. We here report on an aglycon analogue of the antibiotic teicoplanin (code name LCTA-949) that inhibits DENV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in a dose-dependent manner. Virus infection was completely inhibited at concentrations that had no adverse effect on the host cells. These findings were corroborated by quantification of viral RNA levels in culture supernatant. Antiviral activity was also observed against other flaviviruses such as the yellow fever virus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In particular, potent antiviral activity was observed against TBEV. Time-of-drugaddition experiments indicated that LCTA-949 inhibits an early stage in the DENV replication cycle; however, a virucidal effect was excluded. This observation was corroborated by the fact that LCTA-949 lacks activity on DENV subgenomic replicon (that does not encode structural proteins) replication. Using a microsopy-based binding and fusion assay employing DiD-labeled viruses, it was shown that LCTA-949 targets the early stage (binding/entry) of the infection. Moreover, LCTA-949 efficiently inhibits infectivity of DENV particles pre-opsonized with antibodies, thus potentially also inhibiting antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). In conclusion, LCTA-949 exerts in vitro activity against several flaviviruses and does so (as shown for DENV) by interfering with an early step in the viral replication cycle.	Virus or virus-antibody complexes were added to 2610 5 P388D1 cells at MOI 10 of DENV-2 16681 in the presence or absence of serial two-fold dilutions of LCTA-949, and incubated at 37uC with 5% CO 2 for 1 h. DENV-2 anti-E antibodies were generously provided by M. Diamond (Washington University, St. Louis, USA). Cells were then washed with PBS and new media was added. At 43 hpi, the cells were fixed and stained for FACS analysis as previously described [30] . The number of infected cells was determined using the anti-E monoclonal antibody MAB8702 (Millipore). For virus-antibody complex formation, virus particles were incubated for 1 h at 37uC with murine anti-E antibodies, DV2-104 (400 ng/ml), DV2-48 or DV2-96 in cell culture medium containing 2% FBS prior to the addition to cells [31] . The EC 50 and EC 90 were defined according to the percentage of infectivity inhibition relative to that of the positive control. No cytotoxic effects of LCTA-949 were observed at the concentrations evaluated.|
290	11e4df66b6fc6a6eae28a01eb057cef1bf5fadf6	A randomized controlled trial of low-dose recombinant human interferons ␣-2b nasal spray to prevent acute viral respiratory infections in military recruits	The military population has a high disease burden of acute viral respiratory infections in China. To assess the efficacy and safety of a low-dose recombinant human interferon ␣-2b (rIFN␣-2b) nasal spray in preventing acute viral respiratory infections in military population, we performed this randomized controlled trial. The results showed that application of the rIFN␣-2b nasal spray had the benefits in prevention of infections caused by influenza A virus, influenza B virus parainfluenza viruses 1-3 and adenovirus species B. However, no benefit was seen in preventing respiratory syncytial virus. No severe adverse events were reported. Therefore, the rIFN␣-2b nasal spray was effective and well tolerated for preventing common viral respiratory infections in the military recruits.	In summary, this randomized controlled trial suggested that the recombinant human interferon ␣-2b nasal spray can be used to prevent common acute viral respiratory infections caused by Flu-A, Flu-B, PIV1-3 and ADV and was generally well tolerated among military recruits. However, the limitations of this trial may be found on sampling and sample size. All subjects enrolled were healthy and young male recruits, so it may be difficult to extrapolate the conclusion to other populations. The sample was not large enough for evaluating the effects for ADV and RSV infections which had relative low incidence in the army recruits. The efficacy of preventing viral respiratory infections by the rIFN␣-2b nasal spray should be evaluated further in different population groups, such as children and the elderly, and more samples should be involved in the further study.|

Many of these studies find an antibody prevalence comparable to the false positive rate of their respective serology tests and the relatively low statistical power associated with each study has invited criticism.	The quality of antibody prevalence estimates depend on sample size and on the specificity/sensitivity of the antibody test. High test specificity increases statistical power. Thus, there is a natural trade-off between investing in tests of high quality, the human resources required to generate large sample sizes, and the speed at which society needs results. The societal and economic consequences between Type I and Type II errors are not equal.|
293	4e85c20dbbcdf9c1fa08d33a979fe70b48c5b05b	New advances in CNS immunity against viral infection		Understanding how peripheral immune cells are recruited to the CNS and interact with resident cells to fight viral infections can greatly improve the development of immunotherapeutics regimens. The need for treatments has become more relevant than ever with the (re)emergence of pathogens like Zika virus, which can cause neonatal microcephaly, adult encephalitis, and neural precursor cell death [87, 88] , and Ebola virus, a pathogen that causes acute hemorrhagic fever and can reactivate up to nine months after an acute infection, leading to meningoencephalitis [89, 90] . Thus far, research on these pathogens has focused on vaccine development [91, 92] ; however, this approach will not necessarily resolve infection in persistently infected hosts. Therefore, continued development of therapies to treat patients persistently infected with neurotropic viruses must remain a high priority.|

Data visualisation and visual analytics has been identified as a key tool in big data analysis because they draw on the human visual and cognitive capabilities to analyse data quickly, intuitively and interactively. However, current visualisation tools and visual analytical systems fall short of providing a seamless user experience and several improvements could be made to current commercially available visualisation tools. By conducting a systematic literature review, requirements of visualisation tools were identified and categorised into six groups: dimensionality reduction, data reduction, scalability and readability, interactivity, fast retrieval of results, and user assistance. The most common themes found in the literature were dimensionality reduction and interactive data exploration.	Big data and the visualisation of large datasets brings many promising opportunities for discoveries of patterns within the data. However, to fully capitalise on these opportunities, visualisation tools must be able to: perform dimensional reduction of multidimensional datasets; perform data reduction as it is not feasible to render each data point; ensure scalability and readability of visualisations; allow the user to interact with the data and visually analyse the data; retrieve results quickly so that the user does not lose their focus; and provide user assistance. Visualisation tools are currently too narrowly focused, and must be more flexible in terms of the data types they are able to process and the functions they are able to perform. As big data continually grows, data visualisation tools must improve rapidly to enable the exploration and analysis of the masses of data that are produced. Data visualization tools must improve at an equally rapid pace.|
297	87942259485c7cb4a8f43ca19a5c3fb7f3bebff9	The COVID-19 epidemic, its mortality, and the role of non- pharmaceutical interventions	COVID-19 has developed into a pandemic, hitting hard on our communities. As the pandemic continues to bring health and economic hardship, keeping mortality as low as possible will be the highest priority for individuals; hence governments must put in place measures to ameliorate the inevitable economic downturn. The course of an epidemic may be defined by a series of key factors. In the early stages of a new infectious disease outbreak, it is crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of the infection. The basic reproduction number (R 0 ), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection ('totally naïve'), determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or, more precisely, the area under the epidemic curve. Estimation of changes in transmission over time can provide insights into the epidemiological situation and identify whether outbreak control measures are having a measurable effect. For R 0 > 1, the number infected tends to increase, and for R 0 < 1, transmission dies out. Non-pharmaceutical strategies to handle the epidemic are sketched and based on current knowledge, the current situation is sketched and scenarios for the near future discussed.	The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. |

Although virus-induced G0/G1 arrest often delays early apoptosis temporarily, a prolonged replication of the infected virus leads host cells to eventual death. In contrast, most mammalian cells with RNA virus persistent infection often escape cytolysis in the presence of productive viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated that the extended endurance of cyclin D1 was clearly associated with the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) expression in BHK-21 cells that are persistently infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).	In conclusion, the extended duration of cyclin D1 may unloose G1/S cell cycle arrest, and the limited expression or activity of GSK-3β contributes significantly to the cyclin D1 endurance in the BHK-21 cells with JEV persistent infection. The overall suppression of p21 Cip1 and p27 Kip1 levels could participate in this limitation of the early phase of cell cycle arrest. The detailed mechanisms of the suppression of these regulatory proteins and the cyclin E depletion in the cells with JEV persistent infection are the next topics to be addressed. Nevertheless, this is the first report that the limitation of cell cycle arrest in mammalian cells with flavivirus persistence is associated with the major players in G1/S progression. The observations in this study may provide an additional stepping stone to elucidating the exact mechanisms of the delicate balance between the persistence of lytic RNA viruses and host cell survival in relation to the cell cycle.|

When invasive fungal sinusitis is suspected in a patient with prolonged neutropenia, treatment should not be delayed. Voriconazole, isavuconazole or liposomal amphotericin B are first-line options. In patients with high suspicion for invasive mucormycosis, liposomal amphotericin B is considered to be the drug of choice for initial therapy. Early surgical debridement by an otolaryngologist must be considered in such cases. |

Their use as constituents of prosthetic device coatings, topically applied agents, and within dental materials is currently being explored. Future developments are likely to concentrate on those nanoparticles with maximal antimicrobial activity and minimal host toxicity. Antimicrobial nanoparticulate metals have received particular attention as a result of their durability. Although certain nanoparticles may be toxic to oral and other tissues, the surface characteristics of a given particle will help to determine whether or not it will have potential for oral applications. Approaches to alter biocompatibility and desired function are now being identified and these include changing the ability to aggregate, application of surface coatings, and altering oxidative state and charge density. |

Evidence highlights some timely mental health care that needs to be developed urgently, such as: use of psychotropic drugs, prescribed by psychiatrists for severe psychiatric comorbidities; specialized psychiatric treatments and appropriate mental health services and facilities for patients with comorbid mental disorders; psychic treatment plans, psychiatric illness progress reports, and health status updates for professionals in the Intensive Care Unit; regular updates to address their sense of uncertainty and fear; psychological counseling using electronic devices and applications (such as smartphones and WeChat); provision of emotional and behavioral responses to extraordinary stress, and psychotherapy techniques such as those based on the stress adaptation model (Xiang et al., 2020 , Maunder et al., 2003 , Folkman and Greer, 2000 . |

Several parasites and potentially pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the fish, but despite a detailed laboratory investigation the cause of the mortality event could not be determined. A second smaller episode of deaths occurred later, with fish dying in a sea-cage that had been stocked several weeks earlier. Similar pathogens, including parasitic infections, were again isolated but again a single causative agent could not be identified as the cause. The authors suggest that multiple stress factors resulting in immunosuppression may have precipitated the mortality events.|

The long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS-COV2 play an important role in viral RNA synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25 th April, 2020. Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated. Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at nsp 13) were identified in important non-structural proteins, which function either as replicase or helicase. A comparative analysis shows 265T>I, 5828P>L and 5865Y>C are unique to USA and not reported from Europe or Asia; while one, 4715P>L is predominant in both Europe and USA. Mutational changes in amino acids are predicted to alter structure and function of corresponding proteins, thereby it is imperative to consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral orf1ab.	Orf1ab polyprotein o f SARS-CoV-2 encompasses mutational spectra. Comparing to the European and Asian strain(s) we observed four characteristic mutations 265T>I (nsp 2), 4715P>L (nsp 12), 5828P>L (nsp 13) and 5865Y>C (nsp 13) which can be considered as a signature pattern for USA. It is noteworthy to mention here that 5828P>L and 5865Y>C, exclusively found in USA till now; whereas 265T>I is found in very low abundance in Asia (4.42%) and not found at all in Europe. 4715P>L is commonly found in both USA (58.1%) and Europe (51.6%) but present in low abundance in Asia(11.2%). 971P>L and 6158F>L are frequently observed in Georgia and South Carolina only representing the South-East region of the country. All of the four signature mutations caused structural alteration in their respective non-structural proteins (nsp 2, nsp 12 and nsp 13). Thereby it is essential to consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral |

Method: The case was described in clinical expression, chest radiography, blood test and treatment. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect H5N6 virus RNA in clinical and environment samples. Epidemiological investigation was performed including case exposure history determinant, close contacts follow up, and environment sample collection. Results: The patient initially developed sore throat and coughs on 27 January 2015. The disease progressed to severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. And the patient died on 6 February. A highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N6 virus was isolated from the tracheal aspirate specimen of the patient. The viral genome analyses revealed that the H5 hemmagglutinin gene belongs to 2.3.4.4 clade. Epidemiological investigation showed that the patient had exposure to wild bird. All close contacts of the patient did not present the same disease in seven consecutive days. A high H5 positive rate was detected in environmental samples from local live poultry markets.

307	c53f6ab8542fa870daf7f632b827128f87bd821b	Effect of Sulfhydryl Reagents on the Infectivity of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus	"The infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was moderately affected by iodoacetic acid and drastically affected by N-ethylmaleimide; the antiviral effect of these sulihydryl reagents was enhanced somewhat by the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. Reducing and/or a!kylating reagents did not affect VSV hemagglutination and the impermeable sulfhydryl reagent, dextran-maleimide, did not significantly influence VSV infectivity. These data indicate that glycoprotein spikes are not the major sites for the antiviral activity of sulfhydryl reagents. [""C]Iodoacetic acid was able to penetrate the virion membrane to bind covalently to the free sulfhydryl groups of all five virion proteins, particularly the reduced disulfides of the L protein. The RNA polymerase activity of intact VSV was inhibited by iodoacetic acid and to a greater extent by N-ethylmaleimide, which probably accounts for the loss of viral infectivity caused by the permeable sulfhydryl reagents."	Earlier studies on the antiviral activity of sulfhydryl reagents implicated surface components of virions as the targets presumably by compromising cellular adsorption and/or penetration of the virus. Evidence that sulfhydryl reagents can affeet capsid proteins or glycoproteins of enveloped virus was largely based on inhibition of hemagglutination by picornaviruses (Philipson and Choppin, 1962) , paramyxoviruses (Scheid and Choppin, 1974) , coronavirus (Pocock, 1978) , and measles virus (Hardwick and Bussell, 1978) . Our experiments reveal that potent sulfhydryl reagents have no effect on the hemagglutinating activity of vesicular stomatitis virus even though the free sulfhydryl groups and reduced disulfides of VSV glycoprotein are effectively blocked. Sulfhydryl reagents capable of penetrating the VSV membrane and reacting with internal proteins quite effectively impaired viral infectivity regardless of whether protein disulfide bonds were reduced. Con-versely, the impermeant bulky reagent, dextran-malemide, had no effect on the infectivity of VSV. The permeable sulfhydryl reagents, iodoacetic acid and Nethyl-maleimide, inhibited the RNA polymerase of intact VSV, whereas dextranmaleimide did not unless the virion membrane was disrupted with Triton X-100. These data suggest that sulfhydryl reagents will inactivate the infectivity of intact VSV only if they are capable of penetrating the membrane and attack the endogenous RNA polymerase of the virion.|

To perform these functions, it has been suggested that protein E can form a membrane destabilizing transmembrane (TM) hairpin, or homooligomerize to form a TM pore. Indeed, in a recent study we reported that the a-helical putative transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms several SDS-resistant TM interactions: a dimer, a trimer, and two pentameric forms. Further, these interactions were found to be evolutionarily conserved. Herein, we have studied multiple isotopically labeled ETM peptides reconstituted in model lipid bilayers, using the orientational parameters derived from infrared dichroic data. We show that the topology of ETM is consistent with a regular TM a-helix. Further, the orientational parameters obtained unequivocally correspond to a homopentameric model, by comparison with previous predictions. We have independently confirmed that the full polypeptide of E protein can also aggregate as pentamers after expression in Escherichia coli. This interaction must be stabilized, at least partially, at the TM domain. The model we report for this pentameric a-helical bundle may explain some of the permabilizing properties of protein E, and should be the basis of mutagenesis efforts in future functional studies.	We have obtained experimental data that shows that ETM, flanked with two lysine residues, incorporated in model lipid bilayers adopts an a-helical conformation, with a transmembrane topology, i.e., C-and N-termini in opposite sides of the lipid bilayer. By comparison with previous computational studies, our orientational data of synthetic ETM labeled isotopically is only consistent with a homopentameric model. This pentameric form could be responsible for the ion channel effects observed in vitro in the full length polypeptide of protein E.

312	9e5d45f81f004de12167fa5ea95bc2df947a1c43	Biology and pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus in periodontal disease		Cytomegalovirus infections of the periodontium may explain several features of periodontitis, such as the insidious disease onset, the site-specificity of the periodontal attachment loss, the mirror-like disease pattern of localized aggressive periodontitis, and the overgrowth of specific bacterial species in the periodontal pocket. The dynamic interaction between infectious cytomegalovirus and host immune responses may partly account for the discontinuous pattern of periodontal disease progression and for the refractory state of disease in the case of inadequate immunity. Cytomegalovirus may participate in the development of periodontitis by causing macrophages and T-cells to release osteoclast-inducing interleukin-1b and tumor necrosis factor-a. Also, gingival fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus exhibit diminished production of collagens I and III and enhanced generation of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 2. However, although biologically plausible, the extent to which cytomegalovirus participates in the destruction of the human periodontium is still a matter of research. Studies are needed to identify the environmental events and pathogenic pathways that trigger activation of cytomegalovirus in the peridontium, the possible link between cytomegalovirus reactivation and periodontitis disease activity, and the importance of anti-cytomegalovirus immunity in controlling periodontal disease. Such information may help to explain why cytomegalovirus and other ubiquitous herpesviruses may cause periodontitis only in a relatively small subset of individuals and teeth. Hopefully, increased knowledge of the immunovirology of cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses in periodontitis may lead to a greater understanding of periodontal host responses and to more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions, including future vaccination against periodontopathic herpesviruses.|
313	98e35a687137cb2b91458118347ad93f7ad188fb	A Human Monoclonal Antibody against Hepatitis B Surface Antigen with Potent Neutralizing Activity	"We describe the production and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for the major hepatitis B virus (HBV) S protein. The mAbs, two IgG1κ and one IgG1λ, were secreted by B-cell clones obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of one person convalescent from acute hepatitis B and one vaccinated individual. The former recognized a denaturation-insensitive epitope within the p24 protein whereas the latter recognized a denaturation-sensitive, conformational epitope located within the HBsAg common ""a"" determinant. This mAb, denominated ADRI-2F3, displayed a very high protective titer of over 43,000 IU/mg mAb and showed an extremely potent neutralizing activity in the in vitro model of HBV infection using primary hepatocytes from Tupaia belangeri as target. Recombinant variable heavy and light domain sequences derived from mAb ADRI-2F3 were cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors and showed identical fine specificity and 1 log 10 higher titer than the original IgG1λ. It is envisaged that such mAb will be able to efficiently prevent HBV reinfection after liver transplantation for end-stage chronic HBV infection or infection after needle-stick exposure, providing an unlimited source of valuable protective anti-HBs antibody."	The humAb presented herein and in particular ADRI-2F3 may advantageously be used to treat or prevent HBV infection, as it neutralizes HBV very efficiently and effectively. Due to its extreme potency, the mAb may be administered at very low quantities, thus contributing to a cost-effective treatment. In general, the antibody may preferably be administered to humans in order to maintain a serum level of between 100 and 200 IU/L serum which is considered protective to avoid reinfection of the engrafted liver. The conventional protective titer of anti-HBs in vaccinated persons is arbitrarily set at 12 IU/L. Moreover, ADRI-2F3 variable domains may advantageously be used to produce an unlimited amount of humAb, without relying on vaccinated donor plasma, as well as recombinant antibodies or other binding molecules effective in the treatment or prevention of HBV infection. It would be desirable that such mAb produced under GMP conditions be used in clinical trials of prophylaxis of HBV reinfection following liver transplantation or prevention of HBV infection following needle-stick exposure. |

Methods: Clinical follow up and qPCR based respiratory, gastrointestinal and vaginal pathogen carriage before and after travel were prospectively assessed in a cohort of medical students departing from Marseille, France. Results: 134 students were included. 73.9%, 38.8% and 5.0% of students reported gastrointestinal, respiratory and vaginal symptoms, respectively. The acquisition rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was 53% and 41%, respectively. The acquisition of respiratory viruses was low but associated with persisting symptoms, while bacterial acquisition ranged from 3.3% for Streptococcus pyogenes to 15.0% for Haemophilus influenzae. Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae acquisition rates were 7.7% and 14.3% respectively. Five students (5.1%) had molecular quantification criteria for bacterial vaginosis on return. Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrates that besides the known risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections and associated changes in intestinal and respiratory microbiota, medical students abroad may also experience changes in vaginal microbiota leading, in some cases, to clinical symptoms or the acquisition of bacterial vaginosis, which may be asymptomatic.	The trend towards studying abroad fosters intercultural exchanges. However, students have a higher exposure to infectious diseases. Although most of their respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were self-limiting, 7.5% of students still had symptoms on return, which could be a source of infection for their family members and patients.|

316	06ccb834413d798d3682ae0a27be857849d6eb4b			Correspondence COVID-19-related cardiac involvement and potential implications for cardiothoracic imaging Q2 Sir Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA enveloped virus, which uses the ACE2 receptor for cellular adherence. 1 Most imaging features reported to date associated with COVID-19 have focused on lung imaging findings as respiratory symptomatology is most common 2,3 ; however, ACE2-expressing cells have been shown to be present in a number of other organs including the myocardium, where nearly 10% of cells demonstrate ACE2 expression. 4 The heart has therefore been identified as a high risk site for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in patients with prior cardiac injury, diabetes mellitus, and/or hypertension treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) where there may be unregulated ACE2 expression. 4, 5 Severe myocarditis has already been reported in patients with COVID-19 6,7 and inflammatory infiltrates in the myocardium have been confirmed on autopsy studies. 8 The high risk for myocardial involvement in patients with COVID-19 has implications for chest imaging. Firstly, as the number of cases continue to rise, COVID-19 may be an increasingly frequent consideration as a potential cause for viral myocarditis on imaging. Secondly, radiologists should be aware that the number of imaging requests for cardiac imaging in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are likely to increase in order to explore for potential causes of cardiac injury such as coronary artery disease or myocarditis. Approximately 40% of hospitalised COVID-19 infected patients have coronary artery disease and nearly a quarter of critically ill patients can have cardiac injury. 9 Differentiating between acute coronary syndromes related to systemic disease and primary cardiac injury will be clinically important for management as treatment remains supportive at present time. 7 To this end, a specific review for coronary calcification or occult features of ischaemic heart disease on chest computed tomography (CT) should be undertaken. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could also be considered in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and with clinical, biochemical, and/or electrocardiography (ECG) changes suggestive of myocardial injury but without an acute coronary syndrome. |
317	fb7c781a3f810539c808b9a3be513f002a281f6f	Estimating the impact of preventive quarantine with reverse epidemiology	The impact of mitigation or control measures on an epidemics can be estimated by fitting the parameters of a compartmental model to empirical data, and running the model forward with modified parameters that account for a specific measure. This approach has several drawbacks, stemming from biases or lack of availability of data and instability of parameter estimates. Here we take the opposite approach -that we call reverse epidemiology. Given the data, we reconstruct backward in time an ensemble of networks of contacts, and we assess the impact of measures on that specific realization of the contagion process. This approach is robust because it only depends on parameters that describe the evolution of the disease within one individual (e.g. latency time) and not on parameters that describe the spread of the epidemics in a population. Using this method, we assess the impact of preventive quarantine on the ongoing outbreak of Covid-19 in Italy. This gives an estimate of how many infected could have been avoided had preventive quarantine been enforced at a given time.	The reverse epidemiology approach bears similarity with the reconstruction of phylogeny from generic data (see e.g. [3] ) and the counterfactual analysis of disruption events in other complex systems (see e.g. [6] ). We are not aware of any such approach to the study of epidemic outbreaks, which we believe is a very promising one.|

Here, we have studied the ability of heparin to inhibit homophilic interactions of RAGE in living cells and studied how heparin related structures interfere with RAGE-ligand interactions. Methods: Homophilic interactions of RAGE were studied with bead aggregation and living cell protein-fragment complementation assays. Ligand binding was analyzed with microwell binding and chromatographic assays. Cell surface advanced glycation end product binding to RAGE was studied using PC3 cell adhesion assay. Results: Homophilic binding of RAGE was mediated by V 1 -and modulated by C 2 -domain in bead aggregation assay. Dimerisation of RAGE on the living cell surface was inhibited by heparin. Sulphated K5 carbohydrate fragments inhibited RAGE binding to amyloid β-peptide and HMGB1. The inhibition was dependent on the level of sulfation and the length of the carbohydrate backbone. α-D-Glucopyranosiduronic acid (glycyrrhizin) inhibited RAGE binding to advanced glycation end products in PC3 cell adhesion and protein binding assays. Further, glycyrrhizin inhibited HMGB1 and HMGB1 A-box binding to heparin. Conclusions: Our results show that K5 polysaccharides and glycyrrhizin are promising candidates for RAGE targeting drug development.	The authors declare no conflict of interest. Our results show that RAGE dimerization occurring in living cells can be inhibited by heparin, RAGE ligand binding can be inhibited by sulphated K5 polysaccharides, and RAGE-AGE interactions and HMGB1 binding to heparin can be inhibited by glycyrrhizin. We conclude that sulphation of D-glucuronic acid and L-iduronic acid structures offer a promising strategy for the development of RAGE targeting molecules.|
319	b566ef73beaf7b88aee39ff62dc1bc0a87c00ba9	BRUNCH: Branching Structure Inference of Hybrid Multivariate Hawkes Processes with Application to Social Media	Multivariate Hawkes processes (MHPs) are a class of point processes where an arrival in one dimension can affect the future arrivals in all dimensions. Existing MHPs are associated with homogeneous link functions. However, in reality, different dimensions may exhibit different temporal characteristics. In this paper, we augment MHPs by incorporating heterogeneous link functions, referred to as hybrid MHPs, to capture the temporal characteristics in different dimensions. Since the branching structure can be utilized to equivalently represent MHPs, we propose a novel model called BRUNCH via intensity-driven Chinese Restaurant Processes (intCRP) to identify the optimal branching structure of hybrid MHPs. Furthermore, we relax the constraint on the shapes of triggering kernels in MHPs. We develop a Monte Carlo-based inference algorithm called MEDIA to infer the branching structure. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BRUNCH and its usefulness in social media applications.	In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model called BRUNCH to infer the branching structure of hybrid MHPs. It bridges a significant chasm between hybrid MHPs (nonlinear MHPs as well) and branching structure inference. We handle the inferencing procedure via the MEDIA method, which provides a heuristic to make coordinated changes to both event links within clusters and cluster links within cascades. Empirically, our model demonstrates good performance and application potential in the real world.|
320	a5b3f4df4b5b773e35f56703b5a653559e82b139	2 Ministry of Health (MINSAL)	In 2016 the World Health Organization identified 21 countries that could eliminate malaria by 2020. Monitoring progress towards this goal requires tracking ongoing transmission. Here we develop methods that estimate individual reproduction numbers and their variation through time and space. Individual reproduction numbers, R c , describe the state of transmission at a point in time and differ from mean reproduction numbers, which are averages of the number of people infected by a typical case. We assess elimination progress in El Salvador using data for confirmed cases of malaria from 2010 to 2016. Our results demonstrate that whilst the average number of secondary malaria cases was below one (0.61, 95% CI 0.55-0.65), individual reproduction numbers often exceeded one. We estimate a decline in R c between 2010 and 2016. However we also show that if importation is maintained at the same rate, the country may not achieve malaria elimination by 2020.	Mapping R c . To map estimates of transmission risk, individual reproduction numbers were divided into those above and below one. The latitude and longitude of the reproduction numbers were included in a geospatial hurdle model implemented in rINLA 54 where demographic and environmental covariates were used to estimate the likelihood of a case having a reproduction number above 1 if imported into the area in 2010 (Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Table 2) ). This is a measure of malaria 'receptivity' or underlying transmission potential rather than overall malaria risk, as importation likelihood is not quantified in this analysis. AUC scores from leave one out cross validation were used to assess model fit ( Supplementary Fig. 4) .|

There is no current standard of care. Clinicians need to be mindful of the toxicity of a wide variety of possibly unfamiliar substances being tested or repurposed to treat COVID-19. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These two medications may precipitate ventricular dysrhythmias, necessitating cardiac and electrolyte monitoring, and in severe cases, treatment with epinephrine and high-doses of diazepam. Recombinant protein therapeutics may cause serum sickness or immune complex deposition. Nucleic acid vaccines may introduce mutations into the human genome. ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen have been suggested to exacerbate the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here, we review the use, mechanism of action, and toxicity of proposed COVID-19 therapeutics.	The unmet need for effective treatments for COVID-19 has spurred pharmaceutical companies to develop or repurpose therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Frontline providers may be unfamiliar with the usage of older therapeutics, such as chloroquine, or medicines typically used by subspecialists, like DNA vaccines, protease inhibitors, or convalescent plasma therapy. In conjunction with effective infection control policies, a combination of measured and reasoned repurposing of existing therapies, development and vetting of novel drugs, and guidance by medical toxicologists may reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and avoid cases where the cure is worse than the disease.|

We wished to examine the relationship between the intensity of media coverage for selected health topics and their actual risk to public health.	then examine the corresponding mortality, but the level of media coverage is not directly available from the LexisNexis database. Also, death is a crude indicator when burden of illness may be a more accurate reflection of health concerns. Chronic diseases caused by smoking and physical inactivity (such as lung and cardiac conditions, or obesity and diabetes) are probably associated with a higher burden of illness than acute infectious diseases (such as SARS or anthrax). Yet, the regularity and commonness of these conditions trigger less media interest than unknown and uncertain health risks.|
324	f9410459142b63fb34eac0375dda7d9b6460b3fe	Persistent Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Infection in the Nasopharynx of Cattle; Tissue-Specific Distribution and Local Cytokine Expression	Tissues obtained post-mortem from cattle persistently infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) were analyzed to characterize the tissue-specific localization of FMDV and partial transcriptome profiles for selected immunoregulatory cytokines. Analysis of 28 distinct anatomic sites from 21 steers infected with FMDV serotype A, O or SAT2, had the highest prevalence of overall viral detection in the dorsal nasopharynx (80.95%) and dorsal soft palate (71.43%). FMDV was less frequently detected in laryngeal mucosal tissues, oropharyngeal mucosal sites, and lymph nodes draining the pharynx. Immunomicroscopy indicated that within persistently infected mucosal tissues, FMDV antigens were rarely detectable within few epithelial cells in regions of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Transcriptome analysis of persistently infected pharyngeal tissues by qRT-PCR for 14 cytokine genes indicated a general trend of decreased mRNA levels compared to uninfected control animals. Although, statistically significant differences were not observed, greatest suppression of relative expression (RE) was identified for IP-10 (RE = 0.198), IFN-β (RE = 0.269), IL-12 (RE = 0.275), and IL-2 (RE = 0.312). Increased relative expression was detected for IL-6 (RE = 2.065). Overall, this data demonstrates that during the FMDV carrier state in cattle, viral persistence is associated with epithelial cells of the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory tract and decreased levels of mRNA for several immunoregulatory cytokines in the infected tissues.	The current work has contributed to further defining the anatomical sites and host processes associated with persistence of FMDV in cattle. Trimodal detection of infectious FMDV, FMDV RNA, and viral antigen has confirmed the importance of the nasopharyngeal mucosal surfaces as sites of FMDV persistence. Although it is well-established that FMDV has immunomodulatory effects at various tissues at various stages of infection, precise understanding of these processes remains elusive. Through comparison of cytokine transcription levels in persistently infected tissues of FMDV-carrier cattle compared to controls, we have demonstrated a general trend of suppression of transcription of most genes examined including type I and II IFN and various interleukins. Although the effects were not statistically significant, there was an undeniable lack of immunostimulation which is often an expected result of a pathogen infection and has been previously reported for FMDV [26] [27] [28] [29] . Further elucidation of viral modulation of host factors associated with the carrier state will reveal mechanisms that may be targeted in order to prevent or cure FMDV persistence. Such efforts are currently underway in our laboratory.|

328	25ec934edd0a8eb7ef55980e5683355f02b2647f	Comment		As the world's health ministers meet this month for the World Health Assembly, we propose five key ways to help prevent mortality and economic shocks from disease outbreaks. First, to accelerate development of new technologies to control outbreaks, donors should expand their financing for CEPI and support the WHO R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics. Second, funding gaps in the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies and the WHO Health Emergencies Programme should be urgently filled and the PEF should be fully financed. Third, all nations should support their own and other countries' national preparedness efforts, including committing to the JEE process. Fourth, we believe it would be valuable to create and maintain a regional and country-level pandemic risk and preparedness index. This index could potentially be used as a way to review preparedness in International Monetary Fund article IV consultations (regular country reports by staff to its Board). Finally, we call for a new global effort to develop long-term national, regional, and global investment plans to create a world secure from the threat of devastation from outbreaks.|

Cytokines are key modulators of the immune and infl ammatory responses functioning in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner stimulating or suppressing cellular activities in infection, innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, infl ammation, and malignancy. Key to an understanding of these regulatory proteins is the recognition of their pleiotropism and sometimes overlapping activities, functional redundancies, and side effects. Their secretion may be induced by an array of different stimuli associated with infection, infl ammation, or tumorigenesis, fi rst releasing waves of (for example) proinfl ammatory molecules followed by antiinfl ammatory cytokines to restore homeostasis. Cytokines therefore induce a diverse range of biological responses including proliferation, differentiation, activation, infl ammation, chemotaxis, and cell death and the nature of an immune or infl ammatory stimulus determines whether an immune response is humoral-or cell-mediated, cytotoxic, immunosuppressive or allergic.	"• Cytokines, currently known to be more than 130 in number, are relatively small signaling proteins of MW < 30 kDa. They are usually glycosylated and produced by a variety of different cells including those of the immune system, epithelia, endothelia, and stroma. Cytokines are key modulators of the immune and infl ammatory responses functioning in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner in infection, innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, infl ammation, and malignancy. Key to an understanding of these regulatory proteins is the recognition of their pleiotropism and sometimes overlapping activities, functional redundancies, and side effects. • In the current genomic phase, cytokines are identifi ed on the basis of homology with known, characterized cytokines. Many original names are still in use and many of the originally described ""factors"" share receptors with other cytokines, for example, some interleukins. • For the 23 FDA-approved cytokine products from the CDER-approved Biologic Products list, the cytokine classifi cation presented is based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. • Nine main families are recognized with most of the cytokines of interest classifi ed in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) families. The approved cytokines are manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. • Hematopoietin family: aldesleukin (rh-interleukin-2 [IL-2]), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), fi lgrastim and tbo-fi lgrastim (rh-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), sargramostim (rh-granulocyte macrophage [GM]-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin), rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoetin alfa, and stem cell factor (r-met-hSCF); IL-1 cytokine family: anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1; interferon family: recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1, and Summary gamma-1; PDGF family: palifermin (rh-keratinocyte growth factor [KGF] ) and becaplermin (rhPDGF-BB); and TGFβ family: rh-bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2 and rhBMP-7. • Interferons are a class of broad-spectrum antiviral cytokines with overlapping, but also some individual, activities. Of most interest for therapy are interferons alfa, beta, and gamma. Virtually all patients treated with interferon alfa experience some adverse effect(s) at some time during therapy. • Interferon alfa preparations occasionally provoke an extensive range of adverse reactions including cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, hematologic, metabolic, urinary tract, and skin adverse events as well as adverse effects on the nervous and sensory systems. • Peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b are covalent conjugates of the recombinant interferon with a single branched bis-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. Pegylation helps to protect the protein from immune recognition and increases the molecule's size thus extending protein half-life and circulatory time and reducing renal clearance. • Peginterferon alfa-2a together with ribavirin is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults who have compensated liver disease and for patients infected with hepatitis C and HIV. Peginterferon alfa-2a alone is approved for patients with chronic hepatitis B. • Interferon alfa-2b is administered extensively for hepatitis B and C as well as several malignancies. • Interferon alfa-induced neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, cognitive dysfunction, and mania are well known and have been intensively studied. Of the patients who develop severe depressive symptoms, most occur within the fi rst 3 months of treatment. The incidence of depressive disorders is estimated to be 23-41 %. Symptoms may be prolonged for 6 months or more after the cessation of therapy. • Autoantibodies and development or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases including hypothyroidism, immune-mediated hemolysis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Raynaud's disease, and mixed connective tissue disease are known to occur in response to interferon alfa therapy. • Pegylated interferon alfa-2b has been associated with acute myocardial infarction, pericarditis, pericardial effusion with tamponade, and sick sinus syndrome producing arrhythmias. • Interstitial lung disease, reported for both interferon alfa-2a and 2b, is seen more frequently with the former agent and with high doses of the latter. Cases of fatal interstitial pneumonitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) following pegylated interferon alfa-2b are known. • Interferon alfa may have adverse effects on the nervous system in the form of seizures in patients with no history of epilepsy, involuntary facial movements and weakness, features resembling multiple sclerosis, restless legs syndrome, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and Bell's palsy.|"

CLEC4M was previously reported to capture artificial HCVpp (pseudoparticle) and transmit it to hepatocytes (transinfection) via CLEC4M-positive cells. It is still not known whether CLEC4M acts as a receptor for HCVcc (cell-culture-produced HCV) transinfection or whether CLEC4M is an entry receptor for HCVcc. Initially, we established stably CLEC4M-positive and HCV-replicationpermissive cell lines by introducing a CLEC4M expression vector into Huh7-25 cells (Huh7-25-CLEC4M) by transfection. Huh7-25 is a mutant cell line that is resistant to JFH-1 HCVcc due to the lack of expression of CD81 but permissive for replication of JFH1 HCV RNA. When Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells were infected with HCVcc and cultured for 6 days, none were positive for infection. Next, to examine whether CLEC4M functions as a receptor for transinfection, Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells were inoculated with HCVcc and thereafter co-cultured with Huh7-it cells, which are susceptible to HCV infection. The amount of HCV RNA was increased in Huh7-it cells co-cultured with Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells, and the transinfection was inhibited in the presence of anti-CLEC4M antibody during inoculation. Thus, CLEC4M cannot substitute for CD81 as an entry receptor for JFH-1 HCVcc. It just mediates transinfection without internalization of HCVcc. CD81 is still crucial for HCV entry into hepatocytes, and CLEC4M in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells may be responsible for hepatotropism of HCV infection by trapping circulating HCV to transmit it to adjacent hepatocytes.	In conclusion, we demonstrate that CLEC4M is a capture receptor for JFH-1 HCVcc but cannot substitute for CD81 as an entry receptor. Therefore, CLEC4M does not mediate cisinfection but does mediate transinfection without internalization of JFH-1 HCVcc. These findings and others suggest that CLEC4M on LSECs is responsible for the hepatotropism of HCV infection by capturing and releasing HCV to adjacent hepatocytes, but not by serving as a receptor for HCV cisinfection.|

Case presentation: A 6-month-old non-vaccinated boy with B. pertussis infection who developed ARDS was treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). During his ECMO support stage, sudden occurred decreasing of ECMO flow implied increasing intrathoracic pressure. The airway spasm followed caused sudden drop of ventilator tidal volume as well as poor lung compliance. Prone position ventilation and bundle care were conducted as lung protection ventilator strategy. After 297-h of ECMO support, the patient was weaned off ECMO, and extubated one week later. Conclusions: In this patient with severe ARDS caused by Bordetella pertussis, ECMO was performed for cardiopulmonary support and rescued the infant with severe pertussis. During ECMO support period, prone position ventilation and care bundle nursing strategy contributed to the relief of continuous airway spasm.	From this case review, we speculated that ECMO management is challenging in patients with pertussis contributing to the high mortality of these patients under ECMO support. Prone position ventilation contributes to better oxygenation and lung compliance. And detailed care bundle is essential for patients with pertussis challenged by recurrent airway spasm. |
336	766e0afdd0d3c2a1f8d9a6c8b318ca401db0a8bd	c Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Hospital	Objectives. Over time, quarantine has become a classic public health intervention and has been used repeatedly when newly emerging infectious diseases have threatened to spread throughout a population. Here, we weigh the economic costs and benefits associated with implementing widespread quarantine in Toronto during the SARS outbreaks of 2003.	Infectious disease researchers and experts worldwide unanimously agree that this not the last time a highly transmittable infectious disease will emerge and spread across the globe. 27 In the words of Dr Alison McGeer, hospital epidemiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, 'We have been warned'. 28 It is highly probable that the next pandemic will be much more contagious and, perhaps, more lethal than SARS. Ultimately, the SARS epidemic in Toronto resulted in relatively few infections and deaths. Had the virus not been contained, it could have spread throughout Canada as well as the rest of the world with much more devastating results. 29 This paper illustrates that it is not only in our humanitarian interest for public health and healthcare officials to remain aggressive in their response to newly emerging infections, it is also in our collective economic interest. Despite somewhat daunting initial costs, quarantine saves both lives and money.|

NEED FOR AN EARLY INTERVENTION	Aims: In spite of the legal claim for one conventional cytological smear per year since 1971 the incidence of cervical cancer in Germany is among the highest in Western Europe. Recently several studies with the use of the ThinPrep Imaging System (TIS) for computerassisted prescreening found a significant increase in sensitivity for HSIL even in comparison with manually read thinlayer smears. Methods: Block-randomised prospective study for the comparison of sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of conventional cytology and thinlayer cytology (TC). In addition all TC slides were analysed with the computerassisted TIS. Altogether 20.000 women attending the routine cancer prevention exam, 10.000 each randomised in two arms, should be included. TC was taken direct-to-vial. Evaluation of the TC smears was limited to cytotechnicians with a minimum experience with > 2000 TC slides. All women with cytological abnormalities (Munich nomenclature) > Pap III = ASC-H/LSIL (non-HPV only)/HSIL were invited for expert colposcopy with biopsy. All histology results will be reviewed. Study endpoint is the detection of histologically verified CIN 2+. Results and Discussion: At the end of recruitment in 25 practices > 21.000 women had been included in boths arms. 46.2% of them had been investigated with conventional cytology and 53.8% with TC/TIS. First results on sensitivity, specificity and PPV will be reported and discussed.	MALIGNANT SEROSAL TUMOUR, UNUSUAL PRESENTATION W. Salman and Z. Twaij East Lancashire Hospitals, Lancashire, UK Objective: We present a case of primary malignant peritoneal mesothelioma with the unusual immunohistochemical profile, desmin positive, EMA negative, and wish to highlight the importance of cautiously interpreting immunohistochemistry profiles when they do not fit the clinical history and histological appearances. Material and Methods: A 64 year old man with a past history of asbestos exposure and a clinical diagnosis of ascites with omental caking underwent ascitic fluid sampling. Three smears and clots were received which showed groups and single atypical mesothelial cells. These cells in the fibrin clot were positive for calretinin, CK 7, CK20 and Desmin . They were negative for EMA, Ber EP4, CK 5/6 and TTF-1. A report was issued stating that the cytology was suspicious of malignancy and biopsy of the omental cake was requested. Several fragments of omental tissue were received. Histology showed infiltration by tumour cells forming solid sheets of epithelioid cells and glandular structures with cellular atypia, nuclear enlargement and nucleoli. The tumour cells were strongly positive for desmin, CK7, calretinin, NSE and WT-1 but negative for EMA, HBME-1 and CK5/6. This was reported as being consistent with abdominal mesothelioma. Two months later the patient died and a post mortem examination was performed. The peritoneal cavity contained 1.5L of straw coloured effusion and almost all of the mesentery and omentum were replaced by tumour. The liver was cirrhotic and there were multiple bilateral pleural plaques. Tissue from the tumour and lungs was taken for histological examination and asbestos fibre analysis. Sections from the tumour showed an identical histology and immunohistochemical profile to that of the previous biopsy. Lung tissue for asbestos fibre count contained 1.47 million asbestos fibres per gram implicating asbestos exposure as the likely cause of the tumour. The cause of death was reported as malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. Paraffin blocks from the omental tumour were sent for electron microscopy. They showed abundant intermediate filaments (tonofilaments) supporting the diagnosis of mesothelioma. There have been several studies comparing the immunohistochemical profiles of benign and malignant mesothelial cells. Unfortunately there is no immunohistochemical stain that, per se, allows separation of benign from malignant mesothelial proliferations. Therefore the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma may be supported by the use of a panel of immunohistochemical stains. These include markers that are commonly expected to react with these tumours (positive markers) and markers that are not commonly expected to react with these tumours (negative markers). Most studies agree that EMA and desmin appear to be the most useful markers in distinguishing benign from malignant mesothelial proliferative lesions. EMA is preferentially expressed in up to 80% of malignant neoplasms and desmin in up to 85% of benign mesothelial lesions. However a recent review found EMA and desmin to both have a low sensitivity & specificity of 70-75%. Results and Conclusion: To our knowledge this case of peritoneal mesothelioma is the first to describe an opposite immunohistochemical profile to that expected, being EMA negative and desmin positive, despite macroscopic and microscopic evidence of malignancy. We suggest that EMA and desmin, whilst being helpful when distinguishing malignant mesothelioma and benign mesothelial cell proliferation, should not be considered infallible when the clinical, cytological and histological appearances suggest an alternative diagnosis. Objective: Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (TBNA) is a minimally invasive procedure that allows sampling of hilar and medias-tinal lymph nodes during bronchoscopy, which is important for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis stage I, since the later involves mesothoracic lymph nodes. In our study we analyze four cases and we present a review of the relevant literature. Materials and Methods: Four patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy without parenchymal pulmonary lesions underwent bronchoscopy. TBNA was performed with sampling from the right subcarinal lymph nodes station. Also, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample was taken. Cytologic material was directly smeared on slides, fixed in 95 0 alcohol and stained with Pap stain. Transbronchial Lung Biopsy (TBLB) was not perfomed in our cases. Results: Cytologic findings form our four patients were consistent with sarcoidosis, showing nonnecrotizing granulomas in all cases and rare multinucleated giant cells in one case. Culture and acid fast stain for tuberculosis bacilli were negative. A definite diagnosis of sarcoidosis stage I was established by the combination of cytologic findings with clinical and radiological picture as well as the results of flow cytometry from BAL. According to recent literature, TBNA shows high diagnostic value with sensitivity rates ranging from 53 to 72% in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis stage I. Also, in 23-42% of the cases TBNA diagnosis was the only means of rendering a morphologic diagnosis. Finally, the combination of TBNA with TBLB increases the diagnostic yield up to 83%. Conclusion: TBNA is valuable in the diagnostic approach of patients with suspected sarcoidosis stage I, since it highly improves the diagnostic yield without any complications for the patient. The practice, knowledge, information and technological advances in cytology have gone a long way since 1970's. Cytology today has become an integral part of Medicine. Cytology investigations in Goa have also increased in leaps and bounds from 1564 patients in 1984 to 6483 patients in 2007.In Goa FNAC is indispensable in many conditions, in Tuberculosis, when patients are anxious to know whether the lesion is benign or malignant, in elderly patients, in recurrent lesions, Metastatic lesions etc. In Goa FNAC is used in superficial organs as well as deep seated organs using Ultrasound or CT scan. Various interesting lesions encountered in Goa of the thyroid, Breast, Salivary glands, Lymph nodes, soft tissues, Lungs, Mediastinum, Liver, Spleen, Kidneys, GIT, Orbit will be presented. Objectives: Salivary gland tumours are uncommon and unique in their morphological complexity, variability and pattern overlapping and therefore are a challenge for cytologists. The purpose of this study is to asses the value of FNAC in differentiation inflammatory and reactive process, benign or malignant tumour and if possible to render a specific diagnosis. Material and Methods: Within 7 years 81 FNAC of minor salivary gland lesions have been performed by a cytologist alone or in a team with maxillofacial surgeon. FNAC was performed using 23G needle attached to 20 ml syringe. The smears were stained with Papenheim, Papanicolaou and Hemacolor rapid staining. The cytological diagnoses were compared with histopathological ones. Results: We acquired adequate material from 72 (88.9%) patients. A total of 49 patients underwent surgery: 28 with benign and 21 with malignant tumours according to the histopathological diagnoses. The most common tumours were pleomorphic adenoma among benign and adenoid cystic carcinoma among malignant tumours. The most commonly affected site was the palate. The team-work of cytologist and surgeon enables specificity of 89.3%, sensitivity of 95.2%, positive predictive value of 87%, negative predictive value of 96.2% and diagnostic accuracy of 91.8%. Conclusion: It is very important to know whether the lesion is malignant or benign for planning surgery and may prompt or postpone decision for surgical intervention. Therefore, FNAC of minor salivary gland lesions should be considered in the first line investigations of these lesions. Introduction: The presence of sporotrichosis in subcutaneous tissue is not a very frequent entity. The early suspicion by cytologic examination of FNA specimen of subcutaneous lesion give us a great help to guide the clinical management. Objective: A case of sporotrichosis into subcutaneous tissue primarily hypothesized by FNA specimens is presented. Material and Methods: The 54 years old male patient was admitted to the hospital because of the presence of a 5cm · 1cm palpable subcutaneous lesion on the anterior thoracic wall with a strong clinical suspicion of malignancy. The patient was occupied as a municipal nursery gardener, was a heavy smoker and heavy drinker. He lived together with his dog that was recently deceased. He was referred for thoracic CT with the result of solid lesions in the Material and methods: All consecutive patients who underwent a EBUS-FNA between January and November of 2008 for mediastinal or hilar lung lesions, and had a diagnosis of non malignancy were included. Rapid on-site evaluation of the specimens obtained was performed in all cases, by means of Diff Quik-stained air-dried smears. Papanicolaou stains and cell blocks were also done. Results: There were 32 diagnosis of benignancy out of 63 EBUS-FNA procedures. A specific diagnosis was achieved in 6 cases (2 tuberculosis, 3 sarcoidosis and 1 tyroglossal duct cyst). The other 26 had normal lymph node cellularity. In 5 cases further study was performed due to high suspicion of malignancy (mediastinoscopy in 3 cases and esophageal ultrasound-guided FNA in 2). Benignancy was confirmed in 4 of them (normal lymph node in 3 and sarcoidosis in 1) and a squamous cell carcinoma was diagnosed in one case. Conclusions: EBUS-FNA is a useful technique for the diagnosis of non-neoplastic pathology presenting as hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. In our series, 19% of cases diagnosed corresponded to sarcoidosis, tuberculosis or thyroid gland pathology. Objective: Prophylactic administration of a quadrivalent HPV6/11/ 16/18 vaccine is 98-100% effective in preventing HPV16/18-related CIN2/3 or AIS. We report the impact of the vaccine on the inci-dence of all Pap tests, colposcopy and definitive therapy, regardless of causal HPV type. Materials and Methods: 17,622 women aged 16-26 were enrolled in 1 of 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Vaccine or placebo was given at Day 1, Month 2 and 6. Pap testing occurred at Day 1 and every 6-12 months for up to 48 months. Colposcopy referral was algorithm-based. Definitive therapy referral was per standard of care. We estimated number of events prevented annually per 10,000 vaccinated women, in terms of risk difference (RD) based on subtracting the rate in the vaccine arm from the rate in the placebo arm in: 1) an unexposed population that approximates sexually naïve females; 2) a mixed population of HPVexposed and unexposed women; and 3) the population of women already exposed to HPV. Results: Within~3.6 years, we observed reductions for all endpoints. In the unexposed population (defined as DNA negative at baseline to all of 14 HPV types, seronegative to HPV6/11/16 and 18, and with a normal Day 1 Pap), the annual estimated number of events prevented per 10,000 vaccinated women was: any Pap abnormality = 138 (RD = 1.38, 95%CI: 0.8, 2.0); any colposcopy = 135 (RD = 1.35, 95%CI: 0.8, 1.9); and any definitive therapy = 58 (RD = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.4, 0.8). In women who were exposed to HPV (defined as DNA positive at baseline to any of 14 HPV types and/or seropositive to HPV6/11/16 or 18), the estimated number of events prevented was similar to the unexposed population: any Pap abnormality = 148 (RD = 1.48, 95%CI: 0.4, 2.6); any colposcopy = 134 (RD = 1.34, 95%CI: 0.2, 2.4); and any cervical definitive therapy = 66 (RD = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.2, 1.1). Conclusions: Our data suggest that whether we offer HPV vaccine to a population of women who are HPV naïve, a mixed population of naïve and exposed (data not shown), or a population of previously exposed women, we could expect to have similar public health impacts in terms of reduction in abnormal Pap tests and procedures in the years immediately following vaccination.|

We have previously reported that the pro-apoptotic activity of this protein is mediated by a characteristic cysteine-rich domain. We now demonstrate that the nucleolar localization of NOA36 is due to a highly-conserved nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) present in residues 1-33. This NoLS is a sequence containing three clusters of two or three basic amino acids. We fused the amino terminal of NOA36 to eGFP in order to characterize this putative NoLS. We show that a cluster of three lysine residues at positions 3 to 5 within this sequence is critical for the nucleolar localization. We also demonstrate that the sequence as found in human is capable of directing eGFP to the nucleolus in several mammal, fish and insect cells. Moreover, this NoLS is capable of specifically directing the cytosolic yeast enzyme polyphosphatase to the target of the nucleolus of HeLa cells, wherein its enzymatic activity was detected. This NoLS could therefore serve as a very useful tool as a nucleolar marker and for directing particular proteins to the nucleolus in distant animal species.	Table S1 Sequence data for the oligonucleotides used in the mutagenesis. The oligonucleotides contained the enzymes restriction sites (highlighted in red) which allowed the cloning of the PCR products into the peGPFN1 vector. Full length NOA36 cDNA was used as template for PCRs. For the m9D10213 and the m14 constructs, two PCR products were generated, which were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and then ligated into the peGFPN1 vector in a two inserts and one vector reaction. The construct D6-33 was generated by annealing the forward and reverse oligonucleotides. The product of the annealing included protruding ends for EcoRI in 59 end and BamHI for 39 end. (PDF)|

Many viruses use certain proteins to counteract restriction by tetherin from their natural hosts, but not from other species. The influenza A virus (FLUAV) has a wide range of subtypes with different host tropisms. Human tetherin (huTHN) has been reported to restrict only specific FLUAV strains and the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes determine the sensitivity to huTHN. Whether tetherins from other hosts can block human FLUAV is still unknown. Here, we evaluate the impact of equine tetherin (eqTHN) and huTHN on the replication of A/Sichuan/1/2009 (H1N1) and A/equine/Xinjiang/1/2007 (H3N8) strains. Our results show that eqTHN had higher restriction activity towards both viruses, and its shorter cytoplasmic tail contributed to that activity. We further demonstrated that HA and NA of A/Hamburg/4/2009 (H1N1) could counteract eqTHN. Notably, our results indicate that four amino acids, 13T and 49L of HA and 32T and 80V of NA, were involved in blocking the restriction activity of eqTHN. These findings reveal interspecies restriction by eqTHN towards FLUAV, and the role of the HA and NA proteins in overcoming this restriction.	In conclusion, our current research evaluates anti-FLUAV activities of huTHN and eqTHN and finds key sites on HA and NA in an SC09 virion context to antagonize eqTHN, which gives us a better understanding of the sequence-specific interaction between FLUAV and tetherin. More work needs to be done to illustrate the detailed molecular mechanism involved in the structure-specific interaction and evolution, which may provide new targets for antiviral intervention.|

Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutic drugs clinically approved for treatments of ZIKV infection, however. And the drugs used for treating ZIKV in pregnant women require a higher safety profile. Here, we identified an anti-asthmatic drug, montelukast, which is of safety profile for pregnant women and exhibited antiviral efficacy against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo. And we showed that montelukast could disrupt the integrity of the virions to release the viral genomic RNA, hence irreversibly inhibiting viral infectivity. In consideration of the neuro-protective activity that montelukast possessed, which was previously reported, it is promising that montelukast could be used for patients with ZIKV infection, particularly for pregnant women.

The high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa necessitates the development of cheap, effective vaccines. One means of production is the use of plants, for which a number of different techniques have been successfully developed. HIV-1 Pr55Gag is a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate: we compared the expression of this and a truncated Gag (p17/p24) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp. using transgenic plants and transient expression via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recombinant tobamovirus vectors. We also investigated the influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein to the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on protein yield. We partially purified a selected vaccine candidate and tested its stimulation of a humoral and cellular immune response in mice.

The data consisting of 1,255 respondents were obtained from visitors to the five leading theme parks. Discriminant analysis was used to analyze respondents' characteristics such as age, benefit sought, product involvement, and risk perception to examine significant differences between the two categories of respondents. Results of this study showed that younger or more frequent visitors more likely continued to visit theme parks during the SARS outbreak. Besides, visitors who continued to visit theme parks perceived greater infectious risk than those who did not visit theme parks during the SARS outbreak.	It is clear that the international hospitality and tourism industry will always benefit from researchers' continuing efforts to confront any possible emerging industry crises in the future. The efforts provide effective suggestions to either the management practitioners or the public policymakers during and after a certain crisis emergence in the industry.|

348	5eb20deb48c231973cf0a796ca1c6898cbf2d07d	Design and Validation with Influenza A Virus of an Aerosol Transmission Chamber for Ferrets	Background: The importance of aerosols in the spread of viruses like influenza is still a subject of debate. Indeed, most viruses can also be transmitted through direct contact and droplets. Therefore, the importance of the airborne route in a clinical context is difficult to determine. The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets. Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two naïve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-µm and an 8-µm aerodynamic diameter. In the described setup, influenza A virus was transmitted through the aerosol route in two out of three experiments, and through aerosols and droplets in all three experiments.	This paper describes a chamber system that can be used for airborne disease transmission studies. The system is airtight and particle size distribution through the system is satisfactory (no significant difference was found for particles <420 nm). The particle separator D 50 can be modulated between 5.07 and 7.8 µm by changing the airflow. To further reduce the D 50 , plates with smaller holes could replace the actual hole plates of the particle separator. This would lead to more accelerated particles and, therefore, more particles being captured by the impaction plates. Ferrets can be used as models for the study of many mammalian viruses, including filovirus [18] , respiratory syncytial virus [19] and Morbillivirus [20] . Therefore, the studies that can be conducted in this chamber system are not limited to influenza viruses. Moreover, this cage system can be adapted to accommodate other animals like rats or rabbits. Indeed, smaller, regular cages can be placed inside the ventilated airtight cages.|

Chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) are efficient in protecting neonatal calves from RVA diarrhea; however, the value of this intervention in calves once diarrhea has appeared is unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the application of RVA-specific IgY as a passive treatment in those cases. The experimental groups were: G1 = RVA-specific IgY treatment; G2 = no Ab treatment; and G3 = colostrum deprived + no Ab treatment. IgY treatment significantly reduced virus shedding, diarrhea duration and severity compared to G2 and G3 calves. However, it caused a partial suppression of systemic Ab responses to RVA that could be associated with less severe diarrhea. The oral treatment with IgY for 7 days was associated with significantly higher antibody secreting cell responses in the calves compared with other groups of animals.	It has been reported that IgY Abs against bovine RVA can be used to prevent virus-associated diarrhea in newborn calves (Vega et al., 2011) . In this work we focus on the treatment of clinical signs of bovine RVA infection once they appear, as many farmers would use a specific treatment more than a preventive one. We also shortened the passive treatment from 14 to 7 days when compared to previous prophylactic experiments by our group Vega et al., 2011) . However, even with only 7 days of twice daily continuous treatment, IgY Abs were a strong and versatile immune strategy against bovine RVA-associated diarrhea. Another important feature is the fact that the passive treatment administered to calves in this experiment consisted mainly of egg yolk powder, which can be easily manipulated and kept at room temperature for long periods of time (even until 12-16 months). These properties emphasize the advantages of egg yolk as a source of specific antibodies. Avian Ab represents both a reduction and refinement in animal use (Karlsson et al., 2004) . When considering Ab production for passive immunotherapy applications, chickens present a much more economical source of large quantities of specific Ab being also less invasive as it only requires daily collection of eggs (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Karlsson et al., 2004; Schade et al., 2005; Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012) . It would be critical to develop an egg yolk powder enriched in IgY Abs directed to several enteropathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhea. This will represent a polyvalent product to be used as a preventive as well as a therapeutic strategy to control calf scours in dairy farms. Being an Ab-based therapy consisting of polyclonal heterologous Abs to bovine RVA, this passive oral treatment will help to control neonatal calf diarrhea. Importantly, this approach will help overcome the problem of microbial resistance to antibiotics, which are used indiscriminately to treat calf diarrhea, offering an innovative, ecological and powerful solution to this serious calf health problem in the dairy industry.|

In 2014, there were further outbreaks of the disease occurring within four months of each other. In this study, the fulllength genome sequences of two genetically distinct PEDV isolates from the outbreaks were characterized. The two PEDV isolates, CBR1/2014 and EAS1/2014, were 28,039 and 28,033 nucleotides in length and showed 96.2% and 93.6% similarities at nucleotide and amino acid levels respectively. In total, we have observed 1048 nucleotide substitutions throughout the genome. Compared to EAS1/2014, CBR1/2014 has 2 insertions of 4 ( 56 GENQ 59 ) and 1 ( 140 N) amino acid positions 56-59 and 140, and 2 deletions of 2 ( 160 DG 161 ) and 1 ( 1199 Y) amino acid positions 160-161 and 1199. The phylogenetic analysis based on full-length genome of CBR1/2014 isolate has grouped the virus with the pandemic variants. In contrast, EAS1/2014 isolate was grouped with CV777, LZC and SM98, a classical variant. Our findings demonstrated the emergence of EAS1/2014, a classical variant which is novel to Thailand and genetically distinct from the currently circulating endemic variants. This study warrants further investigations into molecular epidemiology and genetic evolution of the PEDV in Thailand.

Among them the 2015 middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak imposed great psychological stress on almost all Korean citizens. Following the MERS outbreak, government is reviewing overall infectious disease management system and prioritizing the establishment of mental health service systems for infectious disease. This study makes suggestions for implementing disaster-related mental health service systems by analyzing the example of Gyeonggi Province, which proactively intervened with residents' psychological problems caused by the large-scale outbreak of an infectious disease.	This study was done in a real world not an experimental situation. Mental health service interventions for MERS victims were performed by the law not by the research design. We tried to find out the way how the system works for MERS victims, systematic characteristics how the victims use mental health services, the needs of victims and the possible strategy how to develop mental health service system in the near future especially for the disaster by infectious disease. Nonetheless, it remains significant that the service utilization rate analyzed in this study was much higher than other general mental health situation in Korea; the professionals administering it actively approached and contacted people with problems rather than passively providing information. The need for mental health services is increasing and traditional systems centered on hospitals and medical facilities are ill-suited to addressing many mental health problems. The core value of public mental health services is adequate public accessibility; it is therefore essential for governments to strengthen their professional competence and establish effective |

Standard-Times senior correspondent Steve Urbon describes such temporary quarantine powers, ""Civil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have 'certain powers to quarantine people.'"" 46 Political, economic, social, and ethical issues are always being raised by these strategic measures. Individual rights have often been trampled in the name of public good. The liberty of outwardly healthy persons from lower classes has frequently been violated by isolating or segregating persons suspected of being infected. Marginalized groups of different ethnicities and races have been stigmatized and discriminated against. Quarantine has a line of continuity from the time of plague to the influenza A pandemic in 2009. 46 During plague and cholera outbreaks, the fear of discrimination and mandatory quarantine pushed the lowest social class and minorities to flee from affected areas. This contributed to a more rapid and wider spread of the disease as this regularly occurred in towns affected by deadly disease outbreak. In this global world, the fear caused by mass media can spread the disease farther and faster, playing a larger role than in the past. Entire populations or segments of populations are at the risk of being stigmatized. In the light of new challenges posed by twenty-first century that can lead to the spread of infectious diseases, quarantine, along with other public health tools, retains importance for public health preparedness. Vigilant attention is required to avoid the intolerance and injustice while implementing these measures. Regular, transparent, and comprehensive communications should be used to gain the public trust. Valuable lessons from the past must lead to successful responses to public health emergencies. 46 |"
354	3868d449d1d018addc42aa5f5428a08976a8b190	Development of infectious cDNA clones of Salmonid alphavirus subtype 3	Background: Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is a widespread pathogen in European aquaculture of salmonid fish. Distinct viral subtypes have been suggested based on sequence comparisons and some of these have different geographical distributions. In Norway, only SAV subtype 3 have so far been identified. Little is known about viral mechanisms important for pathogenesis and transmission. Tools for detailed exploration of SAV genomes are therefore needed. Results: Infectious cDNA clones in which a genome of subtype 3 SAV is under the control of a CMV promoter were constructed. The clones were designed to express proteins that are putatively identical to those previously reported for the SAVH20/03 strain. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against a part of the E2 glycoprotein in order to detect expression of the subgenomic open reading frame (ORF) encoding structural viral proteins. Transfection of the cDNA clone revealed the expression of the E2 protein by IFAT, and in serial passages of the supernatant the presence of infectious recombinant virus was confirmed through RT-PCR, IFAT and the development of a cytopathic effect similar to that seen during infection with wild type SAV. Confirmation that the recovered virus originated from the infectious plasmid was done by sequence identification of an introduced genetic tag. The recombinant virus was infectious also when an additional ORF encoding an EGFP reporter gene under the control of a second subgenomic alphavirus promoter was added. Finally, we used the system to study the effect of selected point mutations on infectivity in Chinook salmon embryo cells. While introduced mutations in nsP2 197 , nsP3 263 and nsP3 323 severely reduced infectivity, a serine to proline mutation in E2 206 appeared to enhance the virus titer production.	Predictions of protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility were obtained by submitting the complete E2 sequence of SAVH20/03 to the PredictProtein server [35] . Transmembrane helices were predicted using TMpred http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html. A nucleotide alignment (357 nt) was generated based on 67 previously reported SAV sequences covering the E2 position 206 (accession numbers AJ316244, AJ316246, EF675551 to EF675577, EF675579 to EF675594 and DQ122127 to DQ122146) [17, 25] . Sequences were aligned by AlignX in the VectorNTI package (Invitrogen). The alignment was imported into the software package BEAST for Bayesian reconstruction of phylogeny [53] . The GTR model of nucleotide evolution with a four category gamma rate, and a constant population size assumption, was chosen. Trees were constructed using a relaxed lognormal clock assumption. A prior in lognormal distribution was set on the mean rate parameter, based on a previously reported substitution rate [25] . The MCMC chains were run for 20 million generations and the results were inspected in Tracer 1.4. ESS values were higher than 200 for all parameters. A maximum clade credibility tree was viewed using FigTree, and the tree was obtained using a 10% burnin in TreeAnnotator.|

The magnitude and spread of the disease were surprisingly high and the control of BTV improved significantly with the marketing of BTV8 inactivated vaccines in 2008. During late summer of 2011, a first cluster of reduced milk yield, fever, and diarrhoea was reported in the Netherlands. Congenital malformations appeared in March 2012 and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was identified, becoming one of the very few orthobunyaviruses distributed in Europe. At the start of both epizootics, little was known about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these viruses in the European context and most assumptions were extrapolated based on other related viruses and/or other regions of the World. Standardized and repeatable models potentially mimicking clinical signs observed in the field are required to study the pathogenesis of these infections, and to clarify their ability to cross the placental barrier. This review presents some of the latest experimental designs for infectious disease challenges with BTV or SBV. Infectious doses, routes of infection, inoculum preparation, and origin are discussed. Particular emphasis is given to the placental crossing associated with these two viruses.	The authors declare that they have no competing interests.|

Limiting photoreceptor death and deconstruction during experimental retinal detachment: the value of oxygen supplementation. Am J Ophthalmol 1999;128:155-164. PURPOSE: To investigate the ocular manifestations of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to monitor the possible ocular complications arising from the treatment regimen with high-dose systemic corticosteroid drugs. DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort case series. METHODS: Ninety eyes from 45 patients with the diagnosis of SARS during an epidemic outbreak in Hong Kong were analyzed. Relevant medical and ophthalmic histories were taken. Ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slitlamp, and indirect ophthalmoscopy examination, were performed at baseline and at 2-month and 3-month follow-up. SETTING: Faculty practice in university hospital. RESULTS: Only two patients had mild elevated intraocular pressure at baseline and at subsequent follow-up. There was no loss of visual acuity, cataract progression, or increased cup-disk ratio. Fundus examinations were unremarkable in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not demonstrate any ocular manifestations in patients with SARS. The treatment regimen of high-dose corticosteroid also did not show any significant ocular complications. Routine ocular screening of patients with SARS for diagnosis or for complications might not be indicated. (Am J Ophthalmol 2004; 137:773-774.

No significant elevation in IOP or other corticosteroid-related ocular complications was observed in the short-term follow-up. Coronavirus-associated atypical pneumonia is extremely infectious, and the transmission appears to be through direct contact or contact with respiratory droplets in close vicinity to an infected person. Health care workers are particularly at risk for infection, as reflected by the numbers of those involved. Among the total number of 8,422 cases worldwide, 1,725 (20%) were health care workers. 2 With the unremarkable ophthalmologic findings of this study, routine ocular screening in patients with SARS for diagnosis or for complications may not be worthwhile. P ATIENTS WITH DISORDERS OF THE CONE PHOTORECEPtors often have debilitating photophobia, over and above their decreased visual acuity. This prevents them from optimal visual functioning in the daytime and even in ordinary indoor illumination. Patients often need to wear a baseball cap or visor in addition to light-absorbing glasses and still find it difficult to function.

This review discusses the challenges in identifying the source of this fatal virus and developing effective and safe anti-MERS-CoV vaccines and therapeutics in order to control its spread and to combat any future pandemic.	In conclusion, MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks of a SARS-like illness in the Middle East, is now considered a threat to global public health. While its humanto-human transmission is so far limited, serious concerns over its pandemic potential have been raised. Therefore, researchers must take immediate steps to identify the source of this fatal virus and develop effective and safe anti-MERS-CoV vaccines and therapeutics in order to control its spread and to combat any future pandemic. Fig. 1 . The life cycle of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV first binds, via its S protein, to the receptor DPP4 on the target cell [16] , and then releases its RNA genome, through plasma or endosomal membrane fusion, into the target cell. After transcription and translation, the new genomic RNA and viral proteins are then assembled into virions, which are transported via vesicles and released out of the host cell, in a way similar to SARS-CoV [17] .|
360	1c7b536966e355206379e97fd0e8ef71d71fb143		The Drosophila genome encodes 18 canonical nuclear receptors. All of the Drosophila nuclear receptors are here shown to be present in the genome of the honey bee ( Apis mellifera ). Given that the time since divergence of the Drosophila and Apis lineages is measured in hundreds of millions of years, the identification of matched orthologous nuclear receptors in the two genomes reveals the fundamental set of nuclear receptors required to 'make' an endopterygote insect. The single novelty is the presence in the A. mellifera genome of a third insect gene similar to vertebrate photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (PNR). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this novel gene, which we have named AmPNR -like, is a new member of the NR2 subfamily not found in the Drosophila or human genomes. This gene is expressed in the developing compound eye of the honey bee. Like their vertebrate counterparts, arthropod nuclear receptors play key roles in embryonic and postembryonic development. Studies in Drosophila have focused primarily on the role of these transcription factors in embryogenesis and metamorphosis. Examination of an expressed sequence tag library developed from the adult bee brain and analysis of transcript expression in brain using in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that several members of the nuclear receptor family ( AmSVP , AmUSP , AmERR , AmHr46 , AmFtz-F1 , and AmHnf-4 ) are expressed in the brain of the adult bee. Further analysis of the expression of AmUSP and AmSVP in the mushroom bodies, the major insect brain centre for learning and memory, revealed changes in transcript abundance and, in the case of AmUSP , changes in transcript localization, during the development of foraging behaviour in the adult. Study of the honey bee therefore provides a model for understanding nuclear receptor function in the adult brain.	Probes for in situ hybridization were prepared for each nuclear receptor to be localized from PCR products using specific primers with T3 and T7 promoters attached to the 5′-and 3′ primers, respectively (see Table ) . Synthesis of riboprobes and digoxigeninlabelling were performed by means of in vitro transcription using Roche RNA Labeling Mix (Roche 1277073, Indianapolis, IN). Probes were 400-700 bases in length. Brains to be used in hybridization studies were dissected from the head capsule of cold-anaesthetized bees in a small drop of bee saline (Huang et al., 1991) . Dissected brains and/or whole pupae were immediately transferred to Cryo-M-Bed embedding compound (Bright Instrument Company Ltd, Huntingdon, UK), frozen on to cryostat chucks using powdered dry ice, sectioned at 10 µm, and thaw-mounted on to FisherPlus slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After overnight air-drying, sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, deproteinized with proteinase K (Sigma P5568 St Louis, MO), and treated with acetic anhydride prior to hybridization with a digoxigenin-labelled riboprobe (1000 ng/ml) at 50 °C overnight in 50% formamide. Following posthybridization rinses, sections were incubated with a sheep antidigoxigeninalkaline phosphatase antibody (Roche 1093274), treated with levamisole to block endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity, and developed in NBT/BCIP (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA). Developed slides were coverslipped with CrystalMount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) or glycerol. Sense strand probes were used as controls. All solutions used prior to hybridization were RNase-free. Positive controls for the method and reagents included opsin antisense probes for worker brains (Velarde et al., 2005) and antisense vitellogenin probes for queen abdominal sections.|

In Japan, the test and culling policy is a basic control measure, and implementation of an adequate vaccination program is recommended as a national policy. In addition, optional control measures, including compulsory testing of introduced animals and bulk tank milk (BTM) testing as a mass screening method, are used in several provinces, but their efficacy has not been completely assessed. We evaluated these control measures using the scenario tree model of BVD in Japan, developed in the previous study. The model outputs indicated that compulsory testing of all introduced cattle, rather than only heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle, was cost effective and reduced the risk of BVDV introduction due to animal movement and that BTM testing could effectively monitor most part of the cattle population. Vaccination coverage and BVDV prevalence among introduced cattle could also affect the cost effectiveness of compulsory testing of targeted cattle, particularly under low vaccination coverage or high BVDV prevalence. However, even with the implementation of a highly effective monitoring scheme for many years, BVD risk could not be eliminated; it instead converged at a very low level (0.02%). Disease models with a cost-effective output could be a powerful tool in developing a control scheme for chronic animal diseases, including BVD, with the consent of relevant stakeholders.	In this study, cost effectiveness of optional control measures for BVD, including compulsory testing of introduced animals and BTM testing, were evaluated. The results suggested that the selection of compulsory test animals is critical to increasing cost effectiveness and that BTM testing as a mass screening tool for the entire population is apparently both beneficial and cheap. However, even with a highly effective monitoring scheme, BVD prevalence will not decrease to zero but converge at a very low level. Cost-effective analysis is a powerful tool to develop control measures for chronic animal disease with the consent of stakeholders. More comprehensive cost-effective analysis, in which both expenditure and net production losses are taken into consideration, should prove to be a valuable tool for developing effective animal disease control strategies.|

She was admitted to the hospital with fevers to 39 °C. On examination, she is anxious-appearing, with a temperature of 38.9 °C, a heart rate of 120 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, a blood pressure of 98/64 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on 4 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula. A tunneled central venous catheter is in situ in her right internal jugular vein. Her total white blood cell (WBC) count is <0.5 cells/mm 3 and platelet count is 8000 cells/mm 3 . A chest CT scan shows diffuse patchy bilateral infiltrates (Figure) . She is started on empiric antibiotic coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam, and 3 L of crystalloid are administered. Several hours later, she is more hypotensive, with nadir systolic pressures of 80-88 mmHg, and is more hypoxic, now saturating 85% on 6 L/min nasal cannula oxygen.	HSCT continues to grow as a therapeutic modality and the pool of both potential donors and recipients continues to increase. As HSCT volumes increase and the complexity and potential toxicity of HSCT regimens expands, the number of critically ill HSCT patients will increase [48] . In response to this growing ICU volume, some centers continue to admit HSCT patients to general ICUs, but many high-volume transplant centers have developed specialty HSCT ICUs. While specialty HSCT ICUs have a number of potential benefits, there are few data to support (or dissuade) their development. Development of best practices for the provision of critical care to HSCT patients, including the optimum ICU organization is an important area for study [48] . Great progress in the critical care of HSCT patients has been made, but with continued basic and clinical research and further development of the sub-specialty of oncologic critical care, outcomes for critically ill HSCT patients should continue to improve.|

However, the immunogenic potential and efficiency of exosomes-based tumor vaccine are not satisfactory enough to achieve a curative effect in clinical trials. In this article we investigated whether IL-18 genetic modification of tumor cells can increase the efficacy of exosomes derived from IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells. We transfected carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing tumor cells with a recombinant adenovirus encoding human IL-18 (AdhIL-18) and prepared the exosomes, Exo/IL-18, from IL-18 gene-modified tumor cells. We found that Exo/IL-18 naturally contain CEA and bioactive IL-18. Moreover, Exo-IL-18 are potent in chemoattracting DC and T cells, enhancing the proliferation and Th1 cytokine release of PBMC, and promoting the phenotypic and functional maturation of DC. Furthermore, Exo/IL-18-pulsed DC are quite potent to induce HLA-A*0201-restricted, CEA-specific CD8 + CTL from the PBMC of HLA-A*0201 CEA + cancer patients in vitro. In almost all of these experiments, Exo/IL-18 show more potent functions than the conventionally prepared exosomes derived from parent tumor cells without IL-18 gene modification. Our findings suggest that Exo/IL-18 has more potent capability to induce specific anti-tumor immunity, and our strategy of IL-18 modification of exosomes is a feasible approach to develop exosomesbased tumor vaccines.	The identification of the presence of IL-18 in exosomes provides critical insights into the improvement of tumorderived exosomes. Exosomes expressing cytokines such as IL-18 as adjuvants can thus become one of the attractive strategies in combating cancer. Using this relatively simple strategy, we can incorporate the cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, co-stimulatory molecules or their combinations into exosomes, through which we can obtain cancer vaccines providing sufficient immunogenic molecules for effective cancer immunotherapy in future trials.|

We investigated the hepatic effects of the novel thiazolidinedione (TZDs), lobeglitazone (Duvie) in T2D patients with NAFLD. We recruited drug-naïve or metformin-treated T2D patients with NAFLD to conduct a multicenter, prospective, open-label, exploratory clinical trial. Transient liver elastography (Fibroscan®; Echosens, Paris, France) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) was used to non-invasively quantify hepatic fat contents. Fifty patients with CAP values above 250 dB/m were treated once daily with 0.5 mg lobeglitazone for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was a decline in CAP values, and secondary endpoints included changes in components of glycemic, lipid, and liver profiles. Lobeglitazone-treated patients showed significantly decreased CAP values (313.4 dB/m at baseline vs. 297.8 dB/m at 24 weeks; P = 0.016), regardless of glycemic control. Lobeglitazone improved HbA1C values (7.41% [57.5 mM/M] vs. 6.56% [48.2 mM/M]; P < 0.001), as well as the lipid and liver profiles of the treated patients. Moreover, multivariable linear regression analysis showed that hepatic fat reduction by lobeglitazone was independently associated with baseline values of CAP, liver stiffness, and liver enzymes, and metformin use. Lobeglitazone treatment reduced intrahepatic fat content, as assessed by transient liver elastography, and improved glycemic, liver, and lipid profiles in T2D patients with NAFLD. Further randomized controlled trials using liver histology as an end point are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of lobeglitazone for NAFLD treatment (Clinical trial No. NCT02285205).	In conclusion, we investigated the effects of the anti-diabetic drug lobeglitazone on T2D patients with NAFLD, using transient liver elastography with CAP and gluco-metabolic profile analysis, and found that the method was effective not only in lowering glucose levels but also in reducing intrahepatic fat content. Furthermore, increased steatosis grade and metformin use in patients at baseline, as well as decreased ALT and LSM levels after treatment, were all reliable factors in predicting responsiveness to lobeglitazone. Together, our data indicate that lobeglitazone is a valid, novel therapeutic that should be used to treat NAFLD patients with T2D. |

Choosing between immediate ETI or NIV trial is often difficult when such patients present with an altered mental status. Some guidelines recommend avoiding NIV when consciousness is impaired given the risk of aspiration, and some authors suggest that a pH < 7.25 is highly predictive of NIV failure. Though clinical response to a well-adjusted NIV treatment can be both swift and spectacular, these contraindications probably encourage physicians to proceed to immediate ETI. Some studies indeed report that NIV was not even considered in as many as 60% of patients who might have benefited from this therapy, though ETI related complications might have been avoided had NIV been successfully applied. Case presentation: We report two cases of ARF in COPD patients who were successfully treated by NIV in prehospital setting and avoided ETI despite contraindications (altered mental status with a Glasgow Coma Scale < 8) and failure risk factors (severe respiratory acidosis with pH < 7.25). Conclusion: In COPD patients presenting ARF, NIV trial could be considered even when relative contraindications such as an altered level of consciousness or a severe respiratory acidosis are present.	In conclusion, for COPD patients presenting ARF, NIV trial could be considered even when relative contraindications such as an altered level of consciousness or a severe respiratory acidosis are present. In such cases, continuous medical surveillance is mandatory, and physicians should be ready to perform ETI should complications arise or the trial fail. |

372	9775b80a0f13a6b29c78338b26f40316bec7b71f	How recent advances in molecular tests could impact the diagnosis of pneumonia	Molecular diagnostic tests have been the single major development in pneumonia diagnostics over recent years. Nucleic acid detection tests (NATs) have greatly improved the ability to detect respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens that do not normally colonize the respiratory tract. In contrast, NATs do not yet have an established role for diagnosing pneumonia caused by bacteria that commonly colonize the nasopharynx due to difficulties discriminating between pathogens and coincidental carriage strains. New approaches are needed to distinguish infection from colonization, such as through use of quantitative methods and identification of discriminating cut-off levels. The recent realization that the lung microbiome exists has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumonia involving the interaction between multiple microorganisms. New developments in molecular diagnostics must account for this new paradigm.	• Identifying the microbial etiology of pneumonia is challenging, largely due to difficulty in obtaining uncontaminated specimens from the site of infection and in discriminating between colonizing microorganisms and true pathogens. • Molecular tests, particularly NATs, have been the major advance in pneumonia diagnostics over recent years. • Although uptake has been relatively slow, NATs now have established roles (often as the diagnostic of choice) for the detection of respiratory viruses and several non-colonizing bacteria (e.g. Legionella species). In contrast, NATs have yet to have an established role for several important bacterial pneumonia pathogens (e.g. S. pneumoniae) that also are asymptomatic colonizers of the upper respiratory tract. • Further developments in molecular tests need to focus on methods to help interpret the significance of positive results. The use of quantitative NATs and microbial load cutoffs has shown promise as one means to discriminate between colonizing and pathogenic microorganisms. • The recent revelation that the lung microbiome exists and new knowledge about the interaction between bacteria and viruses has changed the traditional view of pneumonia pathogenesis. New diagnostics need to account for this new paradigm and be less focused on just detecting specific known pathogens.|

Specifically, are some individuals, in some occupations, better suited to work from home? Given a specific occupational group, what determines the distribution of productivity within an occupational group? Answers to these questions can have a profound impact in identifying which different occupational groups will structure their work arrangements. For some occupations, it may be that the nature of the work itself determines the level of productivity workers are able to achieve from home. In essence, individual preferences, personality, and behaviors will have little impact on their level of productivity when working from homeoccupational characteristics will trump individual characteristics and preferences. For other occupations, the opposite might be true. Individuals within a given occupation will show a significant variation in their productivity when performing very similar tasks. In other words,|

The purpose of this study was to assess health care workers' views about respirator use and the features they prefer to be included in the next generation of respirators. Methods: A 63-item survey was distributed to health care workers in 27 units of 2 tertiary care medical centers. Results: From a total of 559 surveys distributed at both hospitals, 159 responses were returned (response rate, 28%). Survey results indicated that health care workers seek respirators that are more comfortable, interfere less with breathing, diminish heat buildup, are disposable, and permit the user to have facial hair. Multivariate analyses suggest that emergency department staff had 12.3 greater odds of wanting a new respirator (P 5 .031) as compared with their referent group. Males were more likely to indicate that the N95 respirator was comfortable to wear versus females (P 5 .003). Conclusion: To increase substantially the acceptance of respiratory protective equipment and improve compliance rates, respirators should be modified to meet the specific needs of health care workers.	The results from this study support the position of the IOM: that currently available respiratory protective equipment should be modified and new respiratory protective equipment should be developed to meet the specific needs of HCWs. The results suggest that HCWs favor respirators that are more comfortable, interfere less with breathing, diminish heat buildup, are disposable, and permit the user to have facial hair. Building new respirators equipped with features identified in this study may be one way of meeting the needs of HCWs and substantially increasing their acceptance of and compliance with prudent, contemporary respiratory protective measures. Completion of definitive clinical effectiveness trials may also positively influence HCWs compliance and deserves further attention and resources. The authors thank the participants for their participation in the survey and Norisse Tellman for her assistance with the distribution and collection of survey materials.|

Bats of several species in southern People's Republic of China harbor SARS-like CoVs and may be reservoir hosts for them. To determine whether bats in North America also harbor coronaviruses, we used reverse transcription-PCR to detect coronavirus RNA in bats. We found coronavirus RNA in 6 of 28 fecal specimens from bats of 2 of 7 species tested. The prevalence of viral RNA shedding was high: 17% in Eptesicus fuscus and 50% in Myotis occultus. Sequence analysis of a 440-bp amplicon in gene 1b showed that these Rocky Mountain bat coronaviruses formed 3 clusters in phylogenetic group 1 that were distinct from group 1 coronaviruses of Asian bats. Because of the potential for bat coronaviruses to cause disease in humans and animals, further surveillance and characterization of bat coronaviruses in North America are needed.	It is possible that another epidemic caused by an emerging coronavirus could occur in the future. As in the SARS epidemic, bats could play a role in future emergence of coronaviruses in humans or other species. Isolation of infectious bat coronaviruses and elucidation of their host ranges, receptor specifi cities, and genetic diversity will greatly aid in our understanding of their potential for emergence.|
376	4fa66424666d45d477de902e00901a2ca3d641d8	The Role of Animal Models In Influenza Vaccine Research	A major challenge for research on influenza vaccines is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans. Vaccines for seasonal influenza have been available for decades and there is a wealth of data available on the immune response to these vaccines in humans, with well-established correlates of protection for inactivated influenza virus vaccines. Many of the seminal studies on vaccines for epidemic influenza have been conducted in human subjects. Studies in humans are performed less frequently now than they were in the past. Therefore, as the quest for improved influenza vaccines continues, it is important to consider the use of animal models for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, and a major challenge is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans.	The evaluation of vaccines for pandemic influenza presents additional challenges, in that, the correlates of protection from AI viruses are not known, and so there may be a greater need for reliance on data from animal studies for these vaccines. It is critical that the behavior of AI viruses with pandemic potential be characterized in a range of animal models. Even from limited observations, it is clear that replication of AI viruses and their ability to cause disease in animals depends on the host species, and is subtype and even strain specific. To date, the level of replication and the immunogenicity of live attenuated AI candidate vaccine viruses seen in animal models have not accurately predicted the behavior of these vaccine viruses in humans. Therefore, pre-clinical safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data from animal studies must be carefully considered in the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines.|

We also aim to correlate the changes in diaphragm thickness and function to outcomes and clinical factors. Methods: This is a prospective, multicentre, observational study. Patients mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h in controlled mode and eventually switched to assisted ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm ultrasound and clinical data collection were performed every 48 h until discharge or death. A threshold of 10% was used to define thinning during controlled and recovery of thickness during assisted ventilation. Patients were also classified based on the level of diaphragm activity during assisted ventilation. We evaluated the association between changes in diaphragm thickness and activity and clinical outcomes and data, such as ventilation parameters. Results: Sixty-two patients ventilated in controlled mode and then switched to the assisted mode of ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm thickness significantly decreased during controlled ventilation (1.84 ± 0.44 to 1.49 ± 0.37 mm, p < 0.001) and was partially restored during assisted ventilation (1.49 ± 0.37 to 1.75 ± 0.43 mm, p < 0.001). A diaphragm thinning of more than 10% was associated with longer duration of controlled ventilation (10 [5, 15] versus 5 [4, 8.5] days, p = 0.004) and higher PEEP levels (12.6 ± 4 versus 10.4 ± 4 cmH 2 O, p = 0.034). An increase in diaphragm thickness of more than 10% during assisted ventilation was not associated with any clinical outcome but with lower respiratory rate (16.7 ± 3.2 versus 19.2 ± 4 bpm, p = 0.019) and Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (37 ± 11 versus 44 ± 13, p = 0.029) and with higher Pressure Muscle Index (2 [0.5, 3] versus 0.4 [0, 1.9], p = 0.024). Change in diaphragm thickness was not related to diaphragm function expressed as diaphragm thickening fraction. Conclusion: Mode of ventilation affects diaphragm thickness, and preservation of diaphragmatic contraction, as during assisted modes, can partially reverse the muscle atrophy process. Avoiding a strenuous inspiratory work, as measured by Rapid Shallow Breathing Index and Pressure Muscle Index, may help diaphragm thickness restoration.	"The mode of ventilation affects diaphragm thickness in ICU patients. While diaphragm atrophy is associated with a longer duration of controlled mechanical ventilation, assisted mode leads to partial restoration of diaphragm thickness, which seems to correlate to a better breathing pattern. These findings on one side underline the need for monitoring respiratory mechanics during spontaneous breathing and avoiding excessive efforts, on the other side provide some data to define the thresholds for ""diaphragm-protective mechanical ventilation"".|"

However, a leg-amputee has to take a series of training after wearing a limb prosthesis, and the training results determine whether a patient can use the limb prosthesis correctly in her/his daily life. Limb prosthesis vendors thus desire to offer the leg-amputee a complete and wellorganized training process, but they often fail to do so owing to the factors such as the limited support of human resource and financial condition of the amputee. This work proposes a prosthesis training system that the amputees can borrow or buy from the limb prosthesis vendors and train themselves at home. Instant feedback messages provided by the prosthesis training system are used to correct their walking postures during the self-training process. An embedded chip is used as a core to establish a body area sensor network for the prosthesis training system. RFID readers and tags are employed to acquire the 3D positioning information of the amputee's limbs in this work to assist in diagnosing the amputee's walking problem. A series of simulations were conducted and the simulation results exhibit the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed prosthesis training system.	The economic factor usually determines whether a leg-amputee can accept complete and sufficient gait training. The cost of the proposed system is affordable to the trainees owing to wide deploy-ment of the low-cost RFIDs. In addition, the new gait samples can be added in the database with the assistance of the experts if a mismatch occurs between the training pattern and the samples recorded in the database. Therefore, the prosthesis training system proposed this work can greatly benefit the amputees because they can borrow or buy from the limb prosthesis vendors and train themselves at home. The future work will focus on developing more advanced algorithms in order to improve the classification accuracy of the proposed work.|

Specifically, we are concerned about the re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga, which is currently -May 2020-stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our model includes two additional states of an individual, confined and quarantined, which are reached when an individual presents COVID-19 symptoms or has undergone a virus test with a positive result. The model also accounts for the interaction dynamics of players, considering three different sources of infection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her team colleagues during training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a match. Our results highlight the influence of the days between matches, the frequency of virus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at the end of the season. Following our findings, we finally present a variety of strategies to minimize the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case the season of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.	Finally, although the results shown here are focused on the resumption of the men's Spanish national league, the conclusions are equally valid for the women's competition. Furthermore, the model could be adapted to any competition in which matches involve some physical contact between players, such as basketball, handball or rugby.|

Of the total suspended bacteria cultured in an indoor environment, Staphylococcus was dominant and occupied 49.0 to 61.3 % of indoor air. Among Staphylococcus, S. aureus were detected in 100 % of households' indoor air ranging from 4 to 140 CFU/m 3 , and 66 % of households were positive for MRSA ranging from 2 to 80 CFU/m 3 . Staphylococcus and S. aureus concentrations correlated with indoor temperature (adjusted β: 0.4440 and 0.403, p<0.0001). Among respiratory viruses, adenovirus was detected in 14 (14 %) samples and influenza A virus was detected in 3 (3 %) samples regarding the indoor air of apartments. Adenovirus concentrations were generally higher in winter (mean concentration was 2,106 copies/m 3 ) than in spring (mean concentration was 173 copies/m 3 ), with concentrations ranging between 12 and 560 copies/m 3 . Also, a strong negative correlation between adenovirus concentrations and relative humidity in indoor air was observed (r = −0.808, p < 0.01). Furthermore, temperature also negatively correlated with adenovirus concentrations (r=−0.559, p<0.05).	Although we did not investigate the people with illness caused by the viruses, S. aureus and MRSA, these results support the possibility that the risk of airborne disease to family members living in homes can exist, and airborne transmission may also occur through the indoor air of homes. Therefore, additional research is needed to understand the potential for the transmission of pathogens by aerosol.|

Ironically, the success in eliminating infection as the most common cause of pediatric mortality over the last 50 years is that pediatric hospitals are no longer designed for quarantine, which would be required following a bioterrorism attack. Indeed, the difficulties in vaccinating a cadre of health care workers against smallpox were highlighted by the sparse participation of health care workers in the voluntary program initiated by the US government. Several pediatric institutions declined to participate at all and others had minimal participation. Presently, it is prudent to assume that children are extremely vulnerable to bioterrorism attacks and that the pediatric health care system is not fully prepared to deal with bioterrorism.|

386	c66db4790344510781ca7d7cba52739ba7f93a24	IFITM1 is a tight junction protein that inhibits hepatitis C virus entry NIH Public Access	Type 1 interferon (IFN) continues to be the foundation for the current standard of care combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, yet the component interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) that mediate the antiviral actions of IFN are not fully defined. Interferoninduced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) is an ISG product that suppresses early stage infection by a number of viruses through an as yet unknown mechanism of action. Moreover, the actions of IFITM1 on HCV infection are not fully elucidated. Here we identify IFITM1 as a hepatocyte tight junction protein and a potent anti-HCV effector molecule. IFITM1 expression is induced early during IFN treatment of hepatocytes and accumulates at hepatic tight junctions in HCV-infected human patient liver during IFN therapy. Additionally, we found that IFITM1 interacts with HCV co-receptors including CD81 and occludin to disrupt the process of viral entry. Thus, IFITM1 is an anti-HCV ISG whose actions impart control of HCV infection through interruption of viral coreceptor function.	interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 ISG interferon stimulated gene . (B) RNA was harvested from HCV-infected patients 24 hours following IFN-α therapy. Patients were categorized as rapid virologic responders (undetectable serum HCV RNA by week 4 of IFN therapy), complete or partial early virologic responders (undetectable serum HCV RNA or > 2 log 10 IU/mL reduction by week 12 of IFN therapy, respectively) or nonresponders (< 2 log 10 IU/mL reduction by week 12 of IFN therapy and serum HCV RNA still detectable by week 24) based on level of Huh7-IFITM1 or Huh7-vector, each with and without neutralizing anti-CD81, were bound with HCV (MOI=1) at 4°C for 1 hour. Cells were either harvested for RNA to assess binding (B) or shifted to 37°C for 5 hours, followed by proteinase K cleavage of external virus and subsequent RNA collection to assess entry (C). HCV copy number was determined by qRT-PCR. The dotted line on the HCV entry panel refers to the limit of detection for this HCV qRT-PCR assay. (* indicates p<0.05) |

In this study, we investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of children with virus-related ARTIs and determined the spectrum of respiratory viruses and their correlation with meteorological variables in Jiading District, Shanghai, China. Nasopharyngeal swabs from 2819 children with ARTIs were collected from August 2011 to December 2014, and used for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. Seventeen respiratory viruses were detected among 691 (24.5 %) of 2819 patients. The highest prevalence of respiratory viruses was detected in the age group of less than 1 year (29.0 %), and the prevalence decreased with age. This suggests that children less than one year old are the most susceptible to infection. Influenza virus (IFV) was the most frequently detected virus (5.8 %), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV) (5.7 %), enterovirus (EV) (4.3 %), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3.6 %). Statistical analysis showed that epidemics of IFV, PIV and EV had distinct seasonal variations. Mean monthly temperature appeared to be the only meteorological factor associated with IFV and PIV infection. These findings will provide valuable information for decisionmaking, prevention and treatment of ARTIs in children.	Conflict of interest None.|

Their function, however, remains an area of speculation with important implications for human health. It is clear from these studies that whatever their purpose, organelle structure is dynamic (M. Ulasli, M. H. Verheije, C. A. de Haan, and F. Reggiori, Cell. Microbiol. 12:844-861, 2010) and intricate (K. Knoops, M. Kikkert, S. H. Worm, J. C. Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Y. van der Meer, et al., PLOS Biol. 6:e226, 2008). But by concentrating on medically important viruses, these studies have failed to take advantage of the genetic variation inherent in a family of viruses that is as diverse as the archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes combined (C. Lauber, J. J. Goeman, M. del Carmen Parquet, P. T. Nga, E. J. Snijder, et al., PLOS Pathog. 9:e1003500, 2013). In this climate, Maier et al. (H. J. Maier, P. C. Hawes, E. M. Cottam, J. Mantell, P.

In conclusion, the study of IBV DMVs highlights the plasticity of the coronavirus replicative organelle, a satisfyingly pleomorphic home for a pleomorphic virus. But perhaps the most important contribution is to show, for the first time, a coronavirus organelle with a clear exit strategy. |

Although considerable research has focused on this important pathogen, little is known about the function of most PRRSV proteins. To examine characteristics of putative nonstructural proteins (nsp) encoded in ORF1b, which have been identified by nucleotide similarity to domains of equine arteritis virus, defined genomic regions were cloned and expressed in the pRSET expression system. One region, nsp10, encoded a protein with a putative helicase domain and was further examined for functional helicase-like activities. PRRSV nsp10 was found to possess a thermolabile and pH-sensitive NTPase activity that was modulated by polynucleotides and to unwind dsRNA in a 5Ј to 3Ј polarity. These results provide the first evidence of the functional properties of PRRSV helicase and further support the finding that nidovirus helicases possess properties that distinguish them from other viral helicases. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)	The unwinding assay was performed in 20 l reactions containing 400 M protein, 12 M substrate in 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0), or HEPES buffer (ph 7.4) containing 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, 100 g/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, 5 mM ATP, and 25 mM NaCl. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 1 h and stopped by adding 5 l of 5ϫ loading buffer (5% SDS/15% Ficoll/100 mM EDTA/ 0.25% bromphenol blue). Controls included in each assay were native (annealed) and denatured (heated at 95°C) substrate in the absence of helicase.

391	dfb7bbd5bd1c70e09f21125cb5c2e611b1dcee4c	Plant tissue distribution and chemical inactivation of six carnation viruses	Carnation mottle virus (CarMV), Carnation etched ring virus (CERV), Carnation vein mottle virus (CVMV), Carnation ringspot virus (CRSV), Carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) and Carnation latent virus (CLV) are the most important viruses affecting carnation crops. All except CERV are RNA viruses. Viral RNA or DNA accumulation on root, stem, leaf, sepal, petal, stamen, pistil and ovary tissues of infected carnation or Saponaria vaccaria plants was analysed by non-isotopic molecular hybridisation. High-titres of CarMV, CRSV, CIRV, and CLV accumulated in all plant tissues whereas CERV and CVMV were irregularly distributed over the plant. Hightitres of all viruses accumulated in leaf, petal, stamen, pistil, and ovary tissues, so leaves or petals are a good tissue for routine diagnosis. Six chemicals were evaluated for inactivation of all carnation viruses in infected extracts. Commercial bleach at 7% (v/v) or NaOH at 0.5% (w/v) was found to inactivate all viruses after 60 s treatment in a systemic S. vaccaria bioassay.	A virus (Jean et al., 2003) . Apparently, sodium hypochlorite can be considered a general virus inactivation agent although a concentration of up to 7-12% is required. However, NaOH was determined to be the most efficient antiviral solution. A concentration of 0.1% was enough to inactivate CVMV and concentrations of between 0.5% and 1% were able to inactivate all carnation viruses. This alkaline treatment was reported to be efficient at low concentrations against a potexvirus and a tobamovirus (1%, Hu et al., 1994; 0.1%, Choi et al., 2000) , poliovirus (4%, Ma et al., 1994) or an asfivirus and an enterovirus (1-1.5%; Turner and Williams, 1999) . Bleach and sodium hydroxide chemical treatments have been reported to degradate the viral nucleic acids (Ma et al., 1994) without causing any apparent structural changes of the virions (Taylor and Butler, 1982) . In addition, it should be noted that RNA is extremely sensitive to degradation by dilute alkali (Lehninger, 1975) . In all chemical treatments, no injury to the inoculated leaves of S. vaccaria plants was observed indicating that absence of viral infection was due to virus inactivation rather than phytotoxic effects. Apparently, chemical treatments at extreme pH are effective in inactivating RNA or DNA viruses. Furthermore, the short incubation time (60 s) required to inactivate the carnation viruses together with the reduced cost make those treatments very attractive in cleaning contaminated material. In fact, after introducing these sanitary practices in a company dealing with large-scale production of carnation cuttings, the incidence of viral infection was significantly reduced.|

In response, severely affected countries have had to consider a range of public health strategies achieved by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: i) ""mitigation"", which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and ii) ""suppression"", aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterised to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK, we assessed the prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. We found that it is possible to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission if social distancing measures are sustained at a sufficient level for a period of months. Our modelling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly-defined forces. Specifically, we found that: i) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, ii) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be vary over time in a precise but unfeasible way, and iii) social distancing must be maintained for a long duration (over 6 months)."

At low temperatures, iQC and 2/1 ACs exhibit spin-glass-like freezing for RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho, while Er and Tm systems do not show freezing behaviour down to the base temperature ~ 2 K. The 1/1 ACs exhibit either spin-glass-like freezing or antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering depending on their constituent Mg content. The Tf values show increasing trend from iQC to 2/1 and 1/1 ACs. In contrast, the absolute values of Weiss temperature for iQCs are larger than those in 2/1 and 1/1 ACs, indicating that the total AFM interactions between the neighboring spins are larger in aperiodic, rather than periodic systems. Competing spin interactions originating from the long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida mechanism along with chemical disorder of Cd/Mg ions presumably account for the observed spin-glass-like behavior in Cd-Mg-RE iQCs and ACs.	The present research set out to compare the magnetic properties of the iQC, 2/1 and 1/1 ACs in the ternary Cd-Mg-RE (RE = Gd ̶ Tm) systems. The following conclusions are drawn from the present work: At higher temperatures (100 K < T < 300 K), all the iQCs and ACs follow Curie-Weiss law. The estimated μeff are close to the calculated values for free RE 3+ . The w values are negative indicating that RE-RE exchange interactions are dominantly AFM. On the other hand, at lower temperatures, iQC and 2/1 ACs exhibit spin-glass-like anomalies for the RE atoms except Tm and Er. The 1/1 ACs exhibit either spin-glass-like freezing or AFM ordering depending on Mg content. The Tf values show increasing trend from iQC to 2/1 and 1/1 ACs. In contrast, | w | values for iQCs are larger than those for 2/1 and 1/1 ACs, indicating that the total AFM interactions between the neighbour spins are larger in aperiodic systems than periodic ones. The combination of chemical disorder and competition between FM and AFM interactions due to the oscillating RKKY polarization, is presumably responsible for the spinglass-like feature that is observed in most of the present compounds.|

395	b4e03c82e343ee7d2b37096dbac5fbf84d783aa5	Evidence for an RNA Pseudoknot Loop-Helix Interaction Essential for Efficient À1 Ribosomal Frameshifting	RNA pseudoknots are structural elements that participate in a variety of biological processes. At À1 ribosomal frameshifting sites, several types of pseudoknot have been identi®ed which differ in their organisation and functionality. The pseudoknot found in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is typical of those that possess a long stem 1 of 11-12 bp and a long loop 2 (30-164 nt). A second group of pseudoknots are distinguishable that contain stems of only 5 to 7 bp and shorter loops. The NMR structure of one such pseudoknot, that of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), has revealed that it is kinked at the stem 1-stem 2 junction, and that this kinked conformation is essential for ef®cient frameshifting. We recently investigated the effect on frameshifting of modulating stem 1 length and stability in IBV-based pseudoknots, and found that a stem 1 with at least 11 bp was needed for ef®cient frameshifting. Here, we describe the sequence manipulations that are necessary to bypass the requirement for an 11 bp stem 1 and to convert a short non-functional IBV-derived pseudoknot into a highly ef®cient, kinked frameshifter pseudoknot. Simple insertion of an adenine residue at the stem 1-stem 2 junction (an essential feature of a kinked pseudoknot) was not suf®cient to create a functional pseudoknot. An additional change was needed: ef®cient frameshifting was recovered only when the last nucleotide of loop 2 was changed from a G to an A. The requirement for an A at the end of loop 2 is consistent with a loop-helix contact similar to those described in other RNA tertiary structures. A mutational analysis of both partners of the proposed interaction, the loop 2 terminal adenine residue and two G ÁC pairs near the top of stem 1, revealed that the interaction was essential for ef®cient frameshifting. The speci®c requirement for a 3 H -terminal A residue was lost when loop 2 was increased from 8 to 14 nt, suggesting that the loop-helix contact may be required only in those pseudoknots with a short loop 2.	For imidizole probing, the end-labelled RNA was mixed with 10 mg carrier tRNA, dried in a desiccator and redissolved in 10 ml 2 M imidizole (pH 7) containing 40 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl 2 . After incubation at 37 C for one to four hours, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 ml of a fresh solution of 2 % (w/v) lithium perchlorate in acetone. The RNA was recovered by centrifugation, washed with acetone, dried, dissolved in water and prepared for gel loading as above. All the structure probing gels included an alkaline hydrolysis ladder of the relevant RNA as a size marker, prepared by dissolving the dried pellet from 3 ml of end-labelled RNA and 10 mg carrier tRNA in 3 ml of 22.5 mM NaHCO 3 , 2.5 mM Na 2 CO 3 and boiling for one to 2.5 minutes. After the addition of an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer, the sample was heated to 80 C for three minutes and loaded immediately onto the gel.|

Among factors significant in the univariate analysis, monocyte count, hypoxaemia, confusion, whole lung involvement, and cidofovir treatment within 7 days after symptom onset were included in the multivariate analysis. Lymphocyte count was not included in the multivariate analysis since it showed colinearity with monocyte count which showed a stronger HR. PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) and tachypnoea were not included in the multivariate analysis because they shared parameters or associated with hypoxaemia which showed the highest HR among these factors. CURB-65 was not included since confusion, which is a component of the CURB-65, showed a higher HR than CURB-65. Time intervals between symptom onset, admission, and cidofovir treatment were not included because they shared values with cidofovir treatment within 7 days after symptom onset, which is the main exposure of the cohort. Admission time from symptom onset was associated with cidofovir administration time because if the patient admitted to the military hospital early, the patient would have a higher chance of receiving cidofovir early. These two variables showed statistically significant linear association.|

We investigated the influence of exogenous NO on airway responsiveness to acetylcholine aerosols (ACH) in normal and in hyperresponsive rabbits. White New Zealand rabbits were anesthetized, intubated, and breathed room air spontaneously. Responses of respiratory parameters in ACH challenge tests were measured. In group A the influence of NO on ACH infusioninduced airway constriction was measured. Airway responses to aerosols from 0.25 to 8.0% ACH solutions in saline were measured with 150 and 300 ppm NO inhalation (groups B and C) and compared with the same animals' responses without NO. Moreover, we examined the influence of NO synthase inhibition on airway responsiveness (group D) and the modulatory effect of NO in hyperresponsive animals (group E). 300 ppm NO inhalation significantly decreased the bronchoconstrictor response to intravenously administered ACH (group A). However, the baseline value of dynamic elastance (E dyn ) was only marginally lower under the influence of 300 ppm NO. During inhalation of 150 or 300 ppm NO, responses to nebulized 2.0% and less ACH solutions remained nearly unaltered. Responses to aerosols of 4.0 and 8.0% diminished significantly (groups B and C). Following 40 min of aerosolized N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) solution (a NO synthase inhibitor, 1.2 mM) inhalation, the response of E dyn to ACH increased significantly in group D. In group E, animals inhaled 500 mg/m 3 ammonium persulfate (APS), an oxidant with various industrial applications, after the first ACH challenge test (0.2, 1.0, and 2.0% ACH). After 2 h of APS exposure, the ACH-induced Abbreviations: ACH, acetylcholine hydrochloride; AHR, airway hyperresponsiveness; APS, ammonium persulfate; AR, airway responsiveness; ARDS, adult respiratory distress syndrome; ⌬P es , respiratory changes in esophageal pressure; E dyn , dynamic elastance; L-NAME, N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; N.S., not significant; S.E.M., standard error of the mean; V Ј, minute volume; VЈ, respiratory airflow; V T , tidal volume; x, mean Offprint requests to: Thomas Mensing Lung (1997) 175:367-377 © Springer-Verlag New York Inc. 1997	ACH-induced airway constrictions could be reduced effectively during inhalation of 300 ppm NO in our rabbit model. After inhibiting the NOS by using the potent NOS inhibitor L-NAME, constrictor airway responses to ACH increased significantly. Moreover, the constrictor responses to ACH in hyperresponsive rabbits decreased under the influence of exogenous NO. The present investigation confirms the modulating influence of NO on AR, especially after induction of AHR by exposure to an occupational irritant.|

Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study. We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants. Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured.

More than two-thirds of emerging, or re-emerging, infectious diseases are thought to originate in wildlife. Despite this, co-ordinated surveillance schemes are rare, and most efforts at disease control operate at the level of crisis management. This review examines the pathways linking zoonoses in wildlife with infection in other hosts, using examples from a range of key zoonoses, including European bat lyssaviruses and Advances in Parasitology, Volume 68	Managing the risks from zoonoses to the health of humans and domestic animals is complex. It is also fundamentally important: virtually all emerging infectious diseases have originated in wildlife. Superficially, the simplest method of control is via a reduction in reservoir host-disease prevalence, this being achieved by culls of host populations. However, effective reductions in population densities can be difficult to achieve in practice and may be undesirable where the target is of conservation concern. For example, most bat species are threatened, and yet they appear to be particularly important sources of emerging viruses (Calisher et al., 2006; Dobson, 2005) ; and despite not being endangered, badgers in the United Kingdom are legally protected. An alternative, and possibly complementary, strategy is to manage the ecological conditions leading to disease spill-overs. This will not only benefit the health of humans and their domestic stock, but must surely also lead to benefits for the conservation and welfare of wild animals.|

The detection of PoRV-LPMV, represents a diagnostic challenge due to the viral RNA being present in very small amounts in tissue samples. In this study, a TaqMan ® real-time PCR assay was designed based on the phosphoprotein gene of PoRV-LPMV, to allow specific amplification and detection of viral RNA in clinical samples. Assay conditions for the primers and probe were optimized using infected PK15 cells and ten-fold serial dilutions of a plasmid containing the whole P-gene. The sensitivity of the developed TaqMan ® assay was approximately 10 plasmid copies per reaction, and was shown to be 1000 fold better than a conventional nested RT-PCR. The performance of this real-time RT-PCR method enables studies of various aspects of PoRV-LPMV infection. Finally, the assay detects all current known variants of the virus.	In summary, a sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of all known isolates of PoRV in clinical samples, with a detection limit of about ten copies per reaction and 0.001 ng RNA/reaction of total RNA, was developed. The assay can be used for further virological studies.|

Analogous to other type-1 fusion glycoproteins, the formation of the six-helix bundle has been suggested to contribute to a conformational change that occurs in the S protein, following receptor binding, to form a fusion-active core that brings the viral and host cell membranes into close proximity, leading to the fusion between these membranes. Importantly, peptides derived from the HR2 sequence were shown to block SARS-CoV infection of Vero cells, suggesting a potential approach to the development of drugs for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infections [59 ,60 ] . This paper provides the most exhaustive analysis of the SARS-CoV genome that has been published to date. It predicts as many as five novel coronavirus RNA processing activities. Four of the enzymes, including two ribonucleases, are conserved in SARS-CoV. The paper provides an important theoretical basis for future studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus (nidovirus) RNA synthesis that, in several aspects, differs from that of other RNA viruses. |

However, to date, the evolutionary mechanisms that govern CoV strain persistence in human populations have not been fully understood. In this study, we characterized the evolution of the major antigen-spike (S) gene in the most prevalent human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 using phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. Among the five known HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to E), higher substitution rates and dN/dS values as well as more positive selection sites were detected in the S gene of genotype D, corresponding to the most dominant HCoV epidemic in recent years. Further analysis showed that the majority of substitutions were located in the S1 subunit. Among them, seven positive selection sites were chronologically traced in the temporal evolution routes of genotype D, and six were located around the critical sugar binding region in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein, an important sugar binding domain of CoV. These findings suggest that the genetic drift of the S gene may play an important role in genotype persistence in human populations, providing insights into the mechanisms of HCoV-OC43 adaptive evolution.	To infer the positive selection sites of S gene at aa level, the deduced aa sequence entropy was determined using BioEdit (version 7.2.5) 29 . The ratios of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution were estimated to evaluate the selection pressures on the OC43 S genes, using the codon-based phylogenetic method in CODEML (distributed in PAML, version 4) 30 . Posterior probabilities of the inferred positive selection sites were calculated using the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) approach which accounts for sampling errors 31 . The chronological evolution of dN changes throughout the evolutionary history of OC43 genotype D was traced using HyPhy software (version 2.2) and dN substitution was estimated using the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree generated from Bayesian MCMC molecular clock analysis 27, 32 . The aa sites were positioned according to the HCoV-OC43_D 5240/07 (KF572844).|
404	dca48fcd1b8a28f470494d64ea3811707e28766b	Dual Host-Virus Arms Races Shape an Essential Housekeeping Protein	Transferrin Receptor (TfR1) is the cell-surface receptor that regulates iron uptake into cells, a process that is fundamental to life. However, TfR1 also facilitates the cellular entry of multiple mammalian viruses. We use evolutionary and functional analyses of TfR1 in the rodent clade, where two families of viruses bind this receptor, to mechanistically dissect how essential housekeeping genes like TFR1 successfully balance the opposing selective pressures exerted by host and virus. We find that while the sequence of rodent TfR1 is generally conserved, a small set of TfR1 residue positions has evolved rapidly over the speciation of rodents. Remarkably, all of these residues correspond to the two virus binding surfaces of TfR1. We show that naturally occurring mutations at these positions block virus entry while simultaneously preserving iron-uptake functionalities, both in rodent and human TfR1. Thus, by constantly replacing the amino acids encoded at just a few residue positions, TFR1 divorces adaptation to ever-changing viruses from preservation of key cellular functions. These dynamics have driven genetic divergence at the TFR1 locus that now enforces species-specific barriers to virus transmission, limiting both the cross-species and zoonotic transmission of these viruses.	MDCK.2 stable cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged TfR1 orthologs were trypsinized and aliquoted in triplicate at a concentration of 2.5610 5 cells/tube. The cells were washed with DPBS with 1% ovalbumin (Sigma). The cells were then resuspended in 200 mL of DPBS with 1% ovalbumin containing 1:500 dilution of FITC-conjugated Mouse transferrin (2.0 mg/mL stock concentration; Jackson ImmunoResearch, 015-090-050) and incubated at 37uC for 60 min. Anti-DDDDK (FLAG) tag antibody conjugated with Allophycocyanin (0.1 mg/mL stock concentration; Abcam, catalog ab72569) was added to the cells at a 1:100 dilution and incubated on ice for 20 min. The cells were then washed twice, resuspended in DPBS with 1% ovalbumin, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were first gated for live cells and then further gated such that all samples were narrowed to the same log decade of receptor expression (capturing the majority of cells but excluding outliers). Where TfR1 expression levels are reported, this is the mean fluorescent intensity within this gated population (10,000 cells). These same 10,000 cells were simultaneously analyzed for transferrin binding with FITC. Analysis of flow cytometry data was performed using FlowJo 8.8.6 (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR).

405	cf53aed78f8724163ee5178c5ba1fb9ad17e27be	A model of bi-mode transmission dynamics of hepatitis C with optimal control	In this paper, we present a rigorous mathematical analysis of a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of hepatitis C. The model is suitable for populations where two frequent modes of transmission of hepatitis C virus, namely unsafe blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, are dominant. The susceptible population is divided into two distinct compartments, the intravenous drug users and individuals undergoing unsafe blood transfusions. Individuals belonging to each compartment may develop acute and then possibly chronic infections. Chronically infected individuals may be quarantined. The analysis indicates that the eradication and persistence of the disease is completely determined by the magnitude of basic reproduction number R c . It is shown that for the basic reproduction number R c \ 1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable. For R c [ 1, an endemic equilibrium exists and the disease is uniformly persistent. In addition, we present the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to investigate the influence of different important model parameters on the disease prevalence. When the infected population persists, we have designed a timedependent optimal quarantine strategy to minimize it. The Pontryagin's Maximum Principle is used to characterize the optimal control in terms of an optimality system which is solved numerically. Numerical results for the optimal control are compared against the constant controls and their efficiency is discussed.	Considering the bounds on v*, we have the characterizations of the optimal control as in (9). Clearly the state and the adjoint functions are bounded. Also it is easily verifiable that state system and adjoint system have Lipschitz structure with respect to the corresponding variables, we obtain the uniqueness of the optimal control for sufficiently small time T (Pontryagin and Boltyanskii 1986) . The uniqueness of the optimal control pair follows from the uniqueness of the optimality system, which consists of (4.1) and (8), with characterizations (9). There is a restriction on the length of the time interval to guarantee the uniqueness of the optimality system. This smallness restriction on the length on the time interval is due to the opposite time orientations of (4.1), and (8); the state problem has initial values and the adjoint problem has final values. This restriction is very common in control problems (Fister et al. (1998; Kirschner et al. (1997) . h|

Currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear. It is believed that once RABV enters the central nervous system (CNS), virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in the periphery cannot pass through the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and into the CNS. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS. In the present study, mouse serum containing VNA was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type RABV. Our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of VNAs is crucial in the clearance of RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced. This present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing VNA therapy for clinical rabies in humans.	Although traditional inactivated RABV vaccines have been used for pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis in humans with high safety and efficacy, they are not useful for delayed treatment and can even accelerate the rabies (CDC, 2010; Rupprecht et al., 2002; Sampath et al., 2005) . Other vaccines, such as, live-attenuated RABV vaccine and recombinant vaccine expressing RABV G, are limited to use only in wildlife animals (Brochier et al., 1991; Hanlon et al., 1998; Schumacher et al., 1993) . Recent studies suggested that live-attenuated vaccines expressing multiple copies of the G or immune-stimulating molecules not only have the potential to replace the traditional inactivated RABV vaccines, but also can clear RABV from the CNS if administered intracerebrally (Faber et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011) . However, intracerebral administration of live-attenuated or recombinant RABV still possesses safety concerns. Our results demonstrated that VNA can be administered by intravenous route and is crucial for RABV clearance from the brain before the appearance of clinical signs. It would be interesting to initiate the treatment after the appearance of clinical signs. However, there are still obstacles to overcome. For example, virus burden will increase and changes in neuronal injury/dysfunction may not be reversible at late stage of RABV infection. Thus further studies are warranted. Nevertheless, the findings presented in this study provide a foundation for developing VNA therapy for human clinical rabies.|

The different national governments have problems evaluating the reach of the epidemic, having limited resources and tests at their disposal. Hence, any means to evaluate the number of persons with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with reasonable level of accuracy is useful. In this paper we present the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project. The objective of this project is the collection and publication of data concerning the number of people that show symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in different countries using open anonymous surveys. While this data may be biased, we conjecture that it is still useful to estimate the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus at a given point in time in these countries, and the evolution of this number over time. We show here the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project in Spain and Portugal.	As mentioned, this document is the first report on the @CoronaSurveys project [7] , describing its status at the end of March 2020. Since then, the project has grown rapidly, with specific surveys open for 24 different countries in 13 different languages, plus two generic surveys open for the rest of countries in English and Arabic. All the data collected and several estimates computed are openly available at the project web site [7] , which also contains plots of the estimates for all countries.|
411	183e393843de9d6c653897f1039ad10af9750347	Patterns of seasonal and pandemic influenza-associated health care and mortality in Ontario, Canada	"Background: Mathematical and statistical models are used to project the future time course of infectious disease epidemics and the expected future burden on health care systems and economies. Influenza is a particularly important disease in this context because it causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. In order to forecast health care utilization during epidemics-and the effects of hospitalizations and deaths on the contact network and, in turn, on transmission dynamics-modellers must make assumptions about the lengths of time between infection, visiting a physician, being admitted to hospital, leaving hospital, and death. More reliable forecasts could be be made if the distributions of times between these types of events (""delay distributions"") were known. Methods: We estimated delay distributions in the province of Ontario, Canada, between 2006 and 2010. To do so, we used encrypted health insurance numbers to link 1.34 billion health care billing records to 4.27 million hospital inpatient stays. Because the four year period we studied included three typical influenza seasons and the 2009 influenza pandemic, we were able to compare the delay distributions in non-pandemic and pandemic settings. We also estimated conditional probabilities such as the probability of hospitalization within the year if diagnosed with influenza. Results: In non-pandemic [pandemic] years, delay distribution medians (inter-quartile ranges) were: Service to Admission 6.3 days (0.1-17.6 days) [2.4 days (-0.3-13.6 days)], Admission to Discharge 3 days (1.4-5.9 days) [2.6 days (1.2-5.1 days)], Admission to Death 5.3 days (2.1-11 days) [6 days (2.6-13.1 days)]. (Service date is defined as the date, within the year, of the first health care billing that included a diagnostic code for influenza-like-illness.) Among individuals diagnosed with either pneumonia or influenza in a given year, 19% [16%] were hospitalized within the year and 3% [2%] died in hospital. Among all individuals who were hospitalized, 10% [12%] were diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during the year and 5% [5%] died in hospital. Conclusion: Our empirical delay distributions and conditional probabilities should help facilitate more accurate forecasts in the future, including improved predictions of hospital bed demands during influenza outbreaks, and the expected effects of hospitalizations on epidemic dynamics."	"The primary challenge in conducting the kind of research presented here is the size of the data sets and the requirement to analyze them in a secure environment. As computing power and the sophistication and availability of software for analyzing ""big data"" increases, much more extensive studies of linked individual-level health-related databases should become feasible.|"

However, progress in therapeutic antibody development was slow and intermittent until recently. The first antibody therapy, murine-derived murononab OKT3 for acute organ rejection, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986, more than a decade after César Milstein and Georges Köhler developed methods for the isolation of mouse monoclonal antibodies from hybridoma cells in 1975. As a result of the scientific, technological, and clinical breakthroughs in the 1980s and 1990s, the pace of therapeutic antibody discovery and development accelerated. Antibodies are becoming a major drug modality with more than two dozen therapeutic antibodies in the clinic and hundreds more in development. Despite the progress, need for improvement exists at every level.

The content of pitcher fluids has been the focus of many fluid protein profiling studies. These studies suggest an evolutionary convergence of a conserved group of similar enzymes in diverse families of pitcher plants. A recent study showed that endogenous proteins were replenished in the pitcher fluid, which indicates a feedback mechanism in protein secretion. This poses an interesting question on the physiological effect of plant protein loss. However, there is no study to date that describes the pitcher response to endogenous protein depletion. To address this gap of knowledge, we previously performed a comparative RNA-sequencing experiment of newly opened pitchers (D0) against pitchers after 3 days of opening (D3C) and pitchers with filtered endogenous proteins (>10 kDa) upon pitcher opening (D3L). Nepenthes ampullaria was chosen as a model study species due to their abundance and unique feeding behaviour on leaf litters. The analysis of unigenes with top 1% abundance found protein translation and stress response to be overrepresented in D0, compared to cell wall related, transport, and signalling for D3L. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis identified DEGs with functional enrichment in protein regulation, secondary metabolism, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport. the transcriptomic landscape of the pitcher dramatically shifted towards intracellular transport and defence response at the expense of energy metabolism and photosynthesis upon endogenous protein depletion. This is supported by secretome, transportome, and transcription factor analysis with RT-qPCR validation based on independent samples. This study provides the first glimpse into the molecular responses of pitchers to protein loss with implications to future cost/benefit analysis of carnivorous pitcher plant energetics and resource allocation for adaptation in stochastic environments.

To prove this hypothesis, the effect of interruption of the olfactory pathway on spread of the virus was studied using in situ hybridization . Unilateral surgical ablation of this pathway prevented spread of the virus via the olfactory tract on the side of the lesion . MHV RNA could be detected, however, at distal sites on the operated side, indicating that the virus spread via well-described circuits involving the anterior commissure from the control (intact) side of the brain . Viral transport via the trigeminal nerve was not affected by removal of the olfactory bulb, showing that the surgical procedure was specific for the olfactory pathway. These results prove conclusively that MHV gains entry to the CNS via a transneuronal route, and spreads to additional sites in the brain via known neuroanatomic pathways.	We thank Drs. M .

But what is their role in the turmoil brought by the current pandemic? The aim of this paper is to show how digital technologies are operating during this first phase of the spreading of COVID-19. The study analyses and debates the current and potential role of digital technologies, focusing on their influence in the industrial and social fields. More specifically we used the blogging platform ""Medium"", which has seen an exponential growth in its production of articles over the last couple of months. Even if different from esteemed scientific sources, this platform provides a structure that suits our analysis. We searched how many times digital technologies are mentioned in articles regarding Coronavirus and, after collecting these articles, we collected page tags (comparable to ""keywords"" in scientific articles) and classified them (technology tags and non-technology tags) to create a graph showing the relation between them. This network allowed us to acknowledge and picture how technologies are currently debated. This was the starting point to discuss the key implications for an imminent future, and question about the impact on industry, society and labour market. What are the opportunities or threats of using technologies of Industry 4.0? Which are the needs rising because of the pandemic and how can technologies help in their fulfillment? How will the industrial scenario change after this pandemic? How will the labour market be affected? How can technologies be advantageous in the emerging social challenges?"	The technologies needed to address the COVID-19 crisis require something similar, but in daily life. The physical contact must decrease to the minimum viable product in order to reduce or mitigate the risk of contagion. Consequently, the physical movement of people and goods must be reduced. The physical concentration of people in the same place must be avoided. In all these cases the remote operation of activities become crucial.|

The MeOH extracts of the fruits of the Paulownia tree yielded many small molecules capable of targeting PLpro. Five of these compounds were new geranylated flavonoids, tomentin A, tomentin B, tomentin C, tomentin D, tomentin E (1-5). Structure analysis of new compounds (1-5) by NMR showed that they all contain a 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety. This chemotype is very rare and is derived from cyclization of a geranyl group with a phenol functionality. Most compounds (1-12) inhibited PLpro in a dose dependent manner with IC 50 's raging between 5.0 and 14.4 lM. All new compounds having the dihydro-2H-pyran group showed better inhibition than their parent compounds (1 vs 11, 2 vs 9, 4 vs 12, 5 vs 6). In kinetic studies, 1-12 emerged to be reversible, mixed inhibitors.	All measurements were made in triplicate. The results were subject to variance analysis using Sigma plot. Differences were considered significant at p <0.05.|

Although lung transplantation is a recognized therapy for children with end-stage lung disease, 29 successful transplantation for ACDMPV is limited to 2 case reports. 17, 19 In a large international registry, the median survival of all children after lung transplant is 5.3 years, with infants having a slightly better median survival of 6.4 years. 30 The mortality and outcomes of the patients transplanted for ACDMPV in our series are comparable with infants and children transplanted for genetic disorders of surfactant metabolism at our institution. 31 Prospective studies such as those being performed through the Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease Research Network are needed to identify genetic, therapeutic, or environmental factors that contribute to delayed presentation or prolonged survival without transplantation. 32 ■ |

Viruses are grouped in terms of their genomic organization in order to facilitate a discussion of both the molecular and pathogenic aspects of their biology. In addition to increasing our understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis and rational drug design, the detailed molecular characterization of these pathogens has provided the potential to identify molecular signatures that can be used to trace outbreaks of viral disease.	In closing, the goal of this chapter is to provide a background in the fundamentals of human virology and provide an overview of the utility and issues surrounding the use of molecular forensics and epidemiology to the world of virology. The rapid evolution of genomic technologies should continue to expand the capacity and impact of this exciting field. I hope that this chapter can be used as a stepping-stone to appreciate and give perspective to these advances.|
423	eea7ee3da4fcd0dc1f2fb5297f169fc08acd6362	Beliefs underlying blood donors' intentions to donate during two phases of an avian influenza outbreak	Using a Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework the current study explored the beliefs of current blood donors (N = 172) about donating during a low and high-risk phase of a potential avian influenza outbreak. While the majority of behavioral, normative, and control beliefs identified in preliminary research differed as a function of donors' intentions to donate during both phases of an avian influenza outbreak, regression analyses suggested that the targeting of different specific beliefs during each phase of an outbreak would yield most benefit in bolstering donors' intentions to remain donating. The findings provide insight in how to best motivate donors in different phases of an avian influenza outbreak.	Despite these limitations, this is the first known Australian study to investigate a range of beliefs underlying blood donation decision making in the context of an avian influenza outbreak. The study adopted a theoretical approach to gain this understanding and used scenariobased methodology to determine the important beliefs guiding blood donation intentions. Such methodology is common when examining risk-associated health behaviors [19, 20] and adopting such an approach allowed for an examination of the underlying factors influencing blood donation across varying levels of risk extent. The findings from the current study suggest that a differing emphasis on specific benefits and costs, the social approval of important others, and addressing (perceived) barriers to donation may assist in maintaining current donors' intentions and, thus, subsequent blood donation behavior during low and high-risk phases of an avian influenza outbreak. Continued blood donation in such an event will, in turn, maximise the benefits to the national health of Australians by maintaining a safe, secure, and sufficient supply of blood and blood products.|

Critical lessons have been learned in the past regarding how healthcare centers respond to public health emergencies and have highlighted the need for improved infection prevention and control, communication, isolation of HHCD patients, and the ability to care for them in specialized units. While it has been shown in past outbreaks of pathogens ranging from Ebola virus to MERS-CoV that children may be less susceptible to these pathogens, critical illness and/or death can still occur. This requires that all healthcare facilities be prepared to identify, isolate, inform, and potentially provide prolonged care for these most vulnerable of patients and their families. The principles of preparedness in all pediatric institutions are achievable, with planning, practice, and dedication.|

Studies show clear person-to-person transmission. The average incubation period is 2-14 days, and mostly 3-7 days. However, in some patients, this period may be longer. Here, we report a familial cluster of COVID-19 where a 47-year-old woman with long-term use of glucocorticoids did not develop any symptoms within the 14day quarantine period but was confirmed with COVID-19 by tested positive of antibody on day 40 after she left Wuhan. Almost at the same time, her father and sister were diagnosed with COVID-19. The results suggest that the long-term use of glucocorticoids might cause atypical infections, a long incubation period, and extra transmission of COVID-19.	We declare no competing interests.|

Efforts to enhance expression levels of transgenes coding for antigenic proteins by exploiting promoters, targeting sequences, and enhancer elements have produced rather low quantities of the antigen in plant tissues, but enough to induce immune responses in feeding studies. This review will cover components of various gene constructs used in developing plant-based vaccines against a myriad of viral and bacterial diseases. Specifically, it will focus on sequences that are involved in targeting the antigen to mucosal tissues of the intestinal tract, thus enhancing the immunogenicity of the plant-based vaccine as well as those components that result in higher accumulation of the protein within the plant.	One area that requires critical attention is the possible role of 234 KORBAN post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in the observed accumulated levels of antigenic proteins reported thus far in various transgenic plants. It is likely that PTGS, a homology-dependent process that reduces cytoplasmic RNA levels, is a limiting factor in transgene expression, and should be investigated (Vaucheret et al., 2001) . Recent studies on expression of various protein-based polymers and other proteins have shown up to 100-fold accumulation of these proteins when these are targeted to plastid rather than nuclear genomes of transgenic plants (Kota et al., 1999; Guda et al., 2000) . Staub et al. (2000) targeted the expression of a recombinant therapeutic protein, human somatotropin (hST), into tobacco chloroplasts. The hST is used in the treatment of hypopituitary dwarfism in children with likelihood for use in the treatment of Turner syndrome, chronic renal failure, HIV wasting syndrome, and possibly treatment of the elderly. Almost a 300-fold increase in hST recombinant protein levels was detected in chloroplast-transformed tobacco plants compared to nuclear-transformed plants (Staub et al., 2000) . Thus, targeting antigenic protein into plastids should be more thoroughly explored as a likely approach to enhance accumulation of antigenic proteins in transgenic plants.|

429	173fc8d9298f013d791e1e03cde5054994963986	A systematic review of the overlap of fluid biomarkers in delirium and advanced cancer-related syndromes	Background: Delirium is a serious and distressing neurocognitive disorder of physiological aetiology that is common in advanced cancer. Understanding of delirium pathophysiology is largely hypothetical, with some evidence for involvement of inflammatory systems, neurotransmitter alterations and glucose metabolism. To date, there has been limited empirical consideration of the distinction between delirium pathophysiology and that of the underlying disease, for example, cancer where these mechanisms are also common in advanced cancer syndromes such as pain and fatigue. This systematic review explores biomarker overlap in delirium, specific advanced cancerrelated syndromes and prediction of cancer prognosis. Methods: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42017068662) was conducted, using MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Web of Science, to identify body fluid biomarkers in delirium, cancer prognosis and advanced cancer-related syndromes of interest. Studies were excluded if they reported delirium tremens only; did not measure delirium using a validated tool; the sample had less than 75% of participants with advanced cancer; measured tissue, genetic or animal biomarkers, or were conducted post-mortem. Articles were screened for inclusion independently by two authors, and data extraction and an in-depth quality assessment conducted by one author, and checked by two others. Results: The 151 included studies were conducted in diverse settings in 32 countries between 1985 and 2017, involving 28130 participants with a mean age of 69.3 years. Seventy-one studies investigated delirium biomarkers, and 80 studies investigated biomarkers of an advanced cancer-related syndrome or cancer prognosis. Overall, 41 biomarkers were studied in relation to both delirium and either an advanced cancer-related syndrome or prognosis; and of these, 24 biomarkers were positively associated with either delirium or advanced cancer syndromes/ prognosis in at least one study. The quality assessment showed large inconsistency in reporting. Conclusion: There is considerable overlap in the biomarkers in delirium and advanced cancer-related syndromes. Improving the design of delirium biomarker studies and considering appropriate comparator/controls will help to better understanding the discrete pathophysiology of delirium in the context of co-existing illness.	This review found that there is large overlap in the biomarkers in delirium and in advanced cancer-related syndromes, although because of the heterogeneity of the studies firm conclusions about the true overlap of delirium and advanced cancer syndrome biomarkers was not possible. More robust conduct and reporting of delirium biomarker studies will help to better understand the pathophysiology of delirium in the context of co-existing pathophysiology. An improved understanding of the clinical and biological associations of delirium and advanced cancer syndromes in future prospective studies will provide and inform the directions of research into delirium in people with advanced cancer.|

More than 125000 confirmed cases and 4,607 death cases have been recorded around more than 118 countries. Unfortunately, a coronavirus vaccine is expected to take at least 18 months if it works at all. Moreover, COVID -19 epidemics can mutate into a more aggressive form. Day level information about the COVID -19 spread is crucial to measure the behavior of this new virus globally. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of day level forecasting models on COVID-19 affected cases using time series models and mathematical formulation. The forecasting models and data strongly suggest that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities, and workplaces (""Social Distancing"")."	"Coronaviruses such as COVID-19 is declared as an international epidemic. Based on this study analysis and modeling, this research recommends that all world countries must mandate substantially more invasive quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities, and workplaces (""Social Distancing"") in the near term when ICU beds are unavailable and patient deaths begin to rise precipitously. This will affect a significantly larger percentage of the world population than is currently affected by voluntary social distancing, including younger people in the workforce who might be asymptomatic but who are forced to work from home and curtail spending and travel. The number of people affected in the world will increase dramatically within the next three weeks.|"

A lack of approved vaccine or drugs currently constitutes a roadblock in controlling disease outbreak and spread. In this study, we generated MERS-CoV VLPs using the baculovirus expression system. Electron microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy results demonstrate that MERS-CoV VLPs are structurally similar to the native virus. Rhesus macaques inoculated with MERS-CoV VLPs and Alum adjuvant induced virus-neutralizing antibodies titers up to 1:40 and induced specific IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD), with endpoint titers reaching 1:1,280. MERS-CoV VLPs also elicited T-helper 1 cell (Th1)mediated immunity, as measured by ELISpot. These data demonstrate that MERS-CoV VLPs have excellent immunogenicity in rhesus macaques, and represent a promising vaccine candidate.	The authors declare no competing interests. |

The universal requirement of (+)RNA viruses for cellular membranes for genome replication, and the formation of membranous replication organelles with similar architecture, suggest that they target essential control mechanisms of membrane metabolism conserved among eukaryotes. Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding the role of key host factors and pathways that are hijacked for the development of replication organelles. In addition, electron tomography studies have shed new light on their ultrastructure. Collectively, these studies reveal an unexpected complexity of the spatial organization of the replication membranes and suggest that (+)RNA viruses actively change cellular membrane composition to build their replication organelles.	We are only beginning to understand the complex details of biogenesis of viral replication organelles and their role in infection of (+)RNA viruses, and many questions still need to be resolved. The shared morphology of replication structures and the apparently universal requirement for active lipid synthesis strongly suggest that key steps of their formation are shared among distantly related viruses. (+)RNA viruses actively change cellular membranes, rather than rely on pre-existing membranes. They relocate key cellular regulators of membrane metabolism, and modulate their activities to create new pathways of membrane remodeling. Redundant networks of crucial viruscell interactions that allow the generation of a favorable replication microenvironment may exist, thereby providing viruses the opportunity to adapt to and evolve under changing conditions. Understanding how viral proteins hijack regulatory mechanisms of membrane metabolism will undoubtedly bring new perspective to many areas of cell biology and will be indispensable for the development of a new generation of anti-viral control strategies.|

However, no information has been published regarding the minimum infectious dose (MID) of PEDV in different pig models. The main objective of this study was to determine the oral minimum infectious dose of PEDV in naïve conventional neonatal piglets and weaned pigs. A U.S. virulent PEDV prototype isolate (USA/IN19338/2013) with known infectious titer was serially ten-fold diluted in virus-negative cell culture medium. Dilutions with theoretical infectious titers from 560 to 0.0056 TCID 50 /ml together with a medium control were orogastrically inoculated (10ml/pig) into 7 groups of 5-day-old neonatal pigs (n = 4 per group) and 7 groups of 21-day-old weaned pigs (n = 6 per group). In 5-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum having titers 560-0.056 TCID 50 /ml, corresponding to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values 24.2-37.6, resulted in 100% infection in each group; 10ml of inoculum with titer 0.0056 TCID 50 /ml (Ct>45) caused infection in 25% of the inoculated pigs. In 21-day-old pigs, 10ml of inoculum with titers 560-5.6 TCID 50 /ml (Ct 24.2-31.4) resulted in 100% infection in each group while 10ml of inoculum with titers 0.56-0.0056 TCID 50 /ml (Ct values 35.3 ->45) did not establish infection in any pigs under study conditions as determined by clinical signs, PCR, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and antibody response. These data reveal that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs compared to weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms.	In summary, using a U.S. PEDV prototype isolate diluted in culture medium, we determined the correlations of PEDV infectious titers to PCR Ct values and genomic copies per ml. We further demonstrated that PEDV infectious dose is age-dependent with a significantly lower MID for neonatal pigs than for weaned pigs. This information should be taken into consideration when interpreting clinical relevance of PEDV PCR results and when designing a PEDV bioassay model. The observation of such a low MID in neonates also emphasizes the importance of strict biosecurity and thorough cleaning/disinfection on sow farms. In this study, the effect of PEDV infectious doses on infection outcomes was evaluated in naïve conventional neonatal and weaned pigs. It must be noted that infectious dose effects in previously exposed or vaccinated pigs may be different from naïve pigs. In addition, a U.S. PEDV prototype cell culture isolate was used in this study and it remains to be determined whether or not U.S. PEDV S-INDEL-variant isolate has similar minimum infectious dose and pathogenicity.|

The TLR-PAMP interaction initiates an intracellular signaling cascade, predominantly culminating in upregulation of antiviral components, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). After activation, various TLR pathways can promote iNOS production via the myeloid differentiation primary response-88 (MyD-88) adapter protein. Subsequently, iNOS facilitates production of nitric oxide (NO), a highly reactive and potent antiviral molecule that can inhibit replication of RNA and DNA viruses. Furthermore, NO can diffuse freely across cell membranes and elicit antiviral mechanisms in various ways, including direct and indirect damage to viral genomes. This review emphasizes current knowledge of NO-mediated antiviral responses elicited after activation of TLR signaling pathways.	Of the two TLR signaling pathways, the MyD-88-dependent signaling pathway is the one that predominantly leads to NO-mediated antiviral responses. Analysis of the current knowledge in the area of TLR-signaling-mediated NO-dependent antiviral responses revealed knowledge deficits in three major areas. Firstly, despite many reports regarding antiviral activity of NO against numerous mammalian and avian viruses based on the use of external NO donor compounds, there is a paucity of information on activation of TLR signaling pathways resulting in endogenous NO production leading to innate antiviral responses in mammalian and avian hosts. Secondly, of the studies that describe activation of TLR signaling pathways leading to NO-mediated antiviral responses, there are very few on NO-mediated antiviral responses in vivo [85] . Consequently, the therapeutic or prophylactic potential of activation of TLR signaling leading to NO-mediated antiviral responses is not well defined for either mammals or birds. Finally, although various MyD-88 signaling pathways are potentially capable of eliciting a NO response, most studies have focused on TLR4 and TLR3 signaling leading to NO-mediated antiviral responses, and further studies are therefore required to clarify the role of other MyD-88 signaling pathways in NO-mediated antiviral responses. |

This has contributed to novel approaches for therapeutic applications including vaccine development and gene therapy-based immunotherapy. Numerous studies in animal tumor models have demonstrated that self-replicating RNA viral vectors can generate antibody responses against infectious agents and tumor cells. Moreover, protection against challenges with pathogenic Ebola virus was obtained in primates immunized with alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Similarly, vaccinated animals have been demonstrated to withstand challenges with lethal doses of tumor cells. Furthermore, clinical trials have been conducted for several indications with self-amplifying RNA viruses. In this context, alphaviruses have been subjected to phase I clinical trials for a cytomegalovirus vaccine generating neutralizing antibodies in healthy volunteers, and for antigen delivery to dendritic cells providing clinically relevant antibody responses in cancer patients, respectively. Likewise, rhabdovirus particles have been subjected to phase I/II clinical trials showing good safety and immunogenicity against Ebola virus. Rhabdoviruses have generated promising results in phase III trials against Ebola virus. The purpose of this review is to summarize the achievements of using self-replicating RNA viruses for RNA therapy based on preclinical animal studies and clinical trials in humans. Molecules 2018, 23, 3310 2 of 22 in the areas of cancer immunotherapy [4,5], vaccine development against infectious diseases [6,7], protein replacement [8], and gene editing [9].	Looking into the future, continuous vector development aiming at delivery and safety improvements will certainly support the progress in therapeutic applications of self-replicating RNA viral vectors. Moreover, dose optimization studies, especially at the clinical level, needs to be conducted. As vaccine development and gene therapy approaches have taken giants leaps recently with classical approaches and more pioneering efforts using viral vectors and nucleic acids. The attractive features of self-replicating RNA viruses relate to the easy of virus production, broad host range, high safety levels due to no risk of chromosomal integration, targeting of DCs, but most importantly the extreme RNA replication in the cytoplasm, which supports high level transgene expression as the basis for generating strong immune responses. Today, RNA-based delivery provides an attractive approach, especially combined with either polymer-or liposome-based encapsulation strategies.|
442	9bc0c7490f95cf3ea2f5cdf7bf1b0555ab19b917		We investigate adaptive strategies to robustly and optimally control the COVID-19 pandemic via social distancing measures based on the example of Germany. Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.	We wish to briefly mention a stronger restriction on the societal cost of the optimal control strategy. In particular, instead of only restricting the cost over the considered horizon of N = 100 weeks, a stronger property is to ensure that at any time t, the previously accumulated policy cost is smaller than the corresponding cost of the baseline policy. This can be done by replacing condition (11d) with the following transient constraint: The corresponding results for both baselines considered in Section 3.2 can be seen in Figure B .11. In this case the number of fatalities are reduced by 33% and 37%, respectively. Thus, also for this more restrictive setting, the optimal controller can significantly reduce the number of fatalities. In addition, in the comparison to the more aggressive baseline we also see that early measures are absolutely crucial, since the two policies are essentially equivalent in the period from 110 days -150 days, i.e., including the critical time period where the ICU capacity is exceeded, but differ significantly over 30 weeks prior to the violation of the ICU capacity. |

The transition temperature of the RBD in a mixing buffer, composed of glycine, sodium acetate, and sodium phosphate with 100 mM sodium chloride, at pH 6.8, determined by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, is 48.74 C. Experimental results showed that the thermal-induced unfolding-folding transition of the RBD follows a two-state model with a reversibility >90%. Using a simple G o-like model and Langevin dynamics we have shown that, in agreement with our experiments, the folding of the RBD is two-state. Theoretical estimates of thermodynamic quantities are in reasonable agreement with the experiments. Folding and thermal unfolding pathways of the RBD also were experimentally and numerically studied in detail. It was shown that the strand b 1 from the N-terminal folds last and unfolds first, while the remaining b-strands fold/unfold cooperatively.	As evident from our study that the unfolding-folding process of the RBD is highly reversible, it is appealing to investigate the pH dependence of the folding of the RBD. Furthermore, our experiments show that a number of residues located in the b 2 and b 4 strands showed non-beta propensities at the tested temperatures (298-308 K) and a more random coil-like propensity for higher temperatures. Whether there is a correlation between the secondary structure propensity of these residues and their thermal stability implied by the simulations remains to be seen. We are working on these problems, and related studies will be reported in a future article.|

While all this is being done with best of intentions so as to contain the spread of this viral disease, this is causing a significant negative impact on mental health of people specially person of obsessive-compulsive disorder with fear of contamination and excessive washing of hands.	As mental health professionals (MHPs), we need to assess as well as educate all patients of anxiety disorders and OCD visiting us about this issue. Providing alternative channels of care like telephonic helplines and online consultations might also help. However, MHPs need to work for welfare of not only their existing patients but for entire society. By educating people about common adverse psychological consequences of such pandemic situations, encouraging health promoting behaviours, integrating available health-care, facilitating problem solving and supporting patients of COVID-19, their family members & health-care providers, MHPs can play a pivotal role in protecting mental health of society at this hour of crisis (Banerjee, 2020) .|

Motivated by modern communication networks spanning multiple providers, we show for the first time how multiple mutually-distrusting parties can successfully compute node EBC while revealing only differentially-private information about their internal network connections. A theoretical utility analysis upper bounds a primary source of private EBC error-private release of ego networkswith high probability. Empirical results demonstrate practical applicability with a low 1.07 relative error achievable at strong privacy budget = 0.1 on a Facebook graph, and insignificant performance degradation as the number of network provider parties grows.	For future work we hope to allocate differential privacy budgets per stage, by optimising utility bounds. We also intend to develop a network model that reflects a person's use of multiple media, so that the node set need not be disjointly partitioned, while the privacy of edges remains paramount.|

Although due to the size of the fullerenes, the fullerenes are applied as a coating to titania, the main principles remain the same. However, large concentration of fullerenes can affect the light adsorption, compromising the photocatalytic reaction. Krishna et al. showed that the ideal mass ratio is 0.001 C 60 /TiO 2 [92] . For the case of the graphene, small titania particles are nucleating on the surface and the process is similar to the nanotubes. However, the exposed graphene can be a chemical magnet for contaminants attracting them, further increasing the overall efficiency [94] .|

Whole exome sequencing revealed homozygous RAG1 mutations thus expanding the spectrum of combined immunodeficiency with autoimmunity and granuloma that can occur with RAG deficiency.	This case is the first report of chronic multifocal osteomyelitis associated with hypomorphic RAG1 mutations and provides further evidence that primarily rheumatologic symptoms may occur in children with hypomorphic RAG1 mutations. Corticosteroids and treatment with TNF-alpha antagonists (but not rituximab) improved his lung and bone inflammation, which suggests a role for activated T cells in disease pathogenesis [22] [23] [24] . The rash that occurred in this patient shared features with erythroderma seen in Omenn syndrome but lacked acanthosis [25] . This case should alert clinicians to include atypical immune deficiency in the differential diagnosis when recurrent infections and granulomatous inflammation occur in patients with rheumatic disease. Early diagnosis and bone marrow transplant is essential to prevent severe complications of autoimmunity and infections and can be lifesaving [9] .|

This MHC class I up-regulation is not due to increased MHC class I synthesis per se, but the result of increased peptide availability in the ER for MHC class 1 assembly. This is most likely due to the interaction of the viral poiyprotein with the ER membrane during viral replication. Flavivirus infection can overcome peptide deficiency in TAP-deficient or non-permissive cell lines such as RMA-S and Syrian hamster cells, BHK and NIL-2. The consequence of this increased MHC class I expression manifests itself in reduced susceptibility to NK cells and augmented lysis by Tc cells. In mice, long-term flavivirus-immune Tc cell memory formation is impaired, following the appearance of strong anti-self Tc cell reactivity observed in in vitro cultures from splenocytes of fiavivirus-primed animals. We hypothesize that fiavivirus-induced MHC class I up-regulation leads to transient T-cell autoimmunity, followed by down-regulation of both autoimmunity and virus-specific Tc cell memory. Furthermore, we speculate that fiavivirus infections of humans in the tropics may be responsible for the observed lower incidience of overt autoimmunity in these geographic regions than in temperate climates where fiaviviruses are not endemic.|

China suffers severely from tick-borne viral diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), but the background of tick-borne viruses is very limited. Here we report the virome profiling of ticks and goat sera from SFTS-epidemic areas, and serological investigation of SFTS virus (SFTSV) and Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV). Results revealed divergent viruses in ticks and goat sera, including SFTSV and NSDV. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the SFTSV identified here was most closely related to human SFTSV in sampling and surrounding areas, and the NSDV to the previously identified NSDV from northeast China. Serological investigation of SFTSV infection in goats revealed intensive activity in those areas. Surprisingly, two different methods of NSDV serological investigation showed no sera positive for this virus.	Sequences of all assembled contigs have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MH835405-MH835448 and the complete genomes of SFTSV SZHL9 and NSDV SZHL16 under accession numbers MH790412-MH790414 and MH791449-MH791451.

In this study, virus neutralization (VN) test was applied for type differentiation of FCoVinfections. Sera of cats which were clinically and serologically diagnosed as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) possessed significantly higher VN titers to type I FCoV, and sera from cats experimentally infected with FIPV type II had high VN titers to type II but not type I viruses. A total of 79 cat sera collected in the years between 2004 and 2005 were examined to evaluate seroprevalence by the VN test, showing the following results: (1) 50 cats (63.3%) were sero-positive to FCoV; (2) of the 50 FCoV positive cat serum samples, 49 (98%) showed significantly higher titers to type I virus and only one (2%) for type II virus. These results indicate that the VN test described here can be used for serological differentiation of FCoV infections of cats, and that FCoV type I is a dominant type in recent years of Japan. #	In conclusion, our newly established VN test can specifically detect and distinguish between types of FCoV infection. In addition, FCoV type I, but not type II, has widely spread among cats population in Japan.|

456	65adb5bb3dfdd3467ab61494da1c6c9689004802	The Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium: A Multi-Site, Multi-Disciplinary Clinical Research Network in the Department of Defense	Introduction: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) result in substantial annual morbidity among military personnel and decrease operational readiness. Herein, we summarize the research efforts of the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP) related to ARIs. Methods: The ARI Research Area of the IDCRP was established in response to the 2009 emergence of pandemic influenza A/H1N1. That year, IDCRP investigators deployed the ARI Consortium Natural History Study (ARIC NHS), a multi-centered, longitudinal observational study to assess etiology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in the U.S. military. The success of this initial effort spurred implementation of several new initiatives. These include the FluPlasma trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy of hyperimmune anti-influenza plasma for the treatment of severe influenza; the self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine (SNIF) trial, which assessed the immunogenicity and acceptance of a self-administered live-attenuated influenza vaccine in military personnel; the Study to Address Threats of ARI in Congregate Military Populations (ATARI), a prospective study of ILI transmission, etiology and epidemiology in recruits; and the Flu Breath Test (FBT) study, a preliminary study of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOC) in influenza patients. In addition, the InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) survey, a daily diary to measure influenza symptoms during clinical trials, was developed. Lastly, the Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the DoD (PAIVED) study, a two-year randomized trial designed to compare the effectiveness of the three types of licensed vaccines, launched in Fall 2018. Results: The on-going ARIC NHS has enrolled over 2000 ILI and SARI cases since its inception, providing data on burden and clinical manifestations of ARI in military personnel and their families. The FluPlasma 2 trial concluded subject enrollment in 2018. Preliminary results from ATARI study show a high frequency of respiratory viruses circulating during the first two weeks of recruit training. Based on assessment of FLU-PRO responses, which were found to be reliable and reproducible, the survey may be a useful tool in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. The Flu Breath Study will complete enrollment in 2019. Findings from PAIVED are intended to provide evidence needed for assessing influenza vaccination policy in the military. Conclusions: The ARI burden in the armed services remains significant every year and the threat is dynamic given emergent and evolving threats, such as influenzas. With strong successes to date, future initiatives of the ARI Research Area will focus on interventional studies, ARI transmission dynamics in congregate military settings, and determinants of risk of pandemic influenza and other emergent respiratory viruses.	The control of ILI and SARI in armed forces personnel is an ongoing challenge for the U.S. military as influenza and clinical pneumonia remain leading causes of hospitalization, despite high vaccination coverage. Outbreaks and pandemics caused by known and emerging respiratory pathogens can result in significant morbidity and mortality, posing a considerable threat to operational readiness. The IDCRP's ARI Research Area remains committed to decreasing the impact of ARI among military populations through clinical research to improve prevention and clinical management. |

Here, we link host susceptibility to viral infection to a network encompassing sulfur metabolism, tRNA modification, competitive binding, and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). We first demonstrate that the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli exerts a protective effect during lambda phage infection, while a tRNA thiolation pathway enhances viral infection. We show that tRNA Lys uridine 34 modification inhibits PRF to influence the ratio of lambda phage proteins gpG and gpGT. Computational modeling and experiments suggest that the role of the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway in infection is indirect, via competitive binding of the shared sulfur donor IscS. Based on the universality of many key components of this network, in both the host and the virus, we anticipate that these findings may have broad relevance to understanding other infections, including viral infection of humans.

The MPS-selected Landrace line showed significantly lower degrees of pulmonary MPS lesions compared with the non-selected Landrace line. When changes in immunity before and after vaccination were compared, the percentage of B cells in the peripheral blood of the MPS-selected Landrace line was significantly lower than that of the non-selected line. Furthermore, the concentration of growth hormone and the mitogen activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the MPS-selected Landrace line showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower increases after vaccination than the non-selected line. Conversely, the concentration of peripheral blood interferon (IFN)-γ and salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) after Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccination was significantly higher in the MPS-selected Landrace line than in the non-selected line. Gene expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 was significantly higher in the MPS-selected Landrace line in immune tissues, with the exception of the hilar lymph nodes. The present results suggest that peripheral blood IFN-γ, salivary IgA TLR2, and TLR4 are important immunological factors influencing the development of MPS lesions.	In conclusion, the MPS-selected Landrace line shows strong resistance against MPS due to the strength of its cell-mediated and mucosal immune responses, as described above. Furthermore, our research indicates that immune system components such as IFN-γ, TLR2, TLR4 and salivary IgA may be working synergistically against MPS. In present studies, cytokine and TLR levels in mucosal tissues, PAMs and salivary IgA were measured only in experiment 2. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the repeatability of these results. In addition, although the MPS-selected Landrace line showed a strong resistance against MPS, further studies to confirm whether this MPS-selected line has resistance to other respiratory chronic diseases are warranted.|

The volume of healthcare-associated cases is an indicator of infection prevention breakdowns, which points to the potential for hospitals to further spread the disease. This is not a unique finding, however, and similar situations have Healthcare investment in biopreparedness is often intermittent and frequently provided only in the face of an outbreak or biological event. This current outbreak should be seen as an opportunity to ensure those efforts are being supported and reinforced by leadership. Hospital leaders often note that investment in prevention and response efforts for seemingly improbable biological events is unlikely due to competing interests. 6 Healthcare biopreparedness goes beyond just ensuring we have enough PPE, but also requires instilling the infection prevention foundation that patient and employee safety precariously rests upon. The future should see international efforts to strengthen the critical healthcare and public health infrastructure across the world, as these vulnerabilities are systemic and deserve the highest attention.|
461	6d1b4e1200c1da4dff5048bdff36805e28511154		It is widely recognized that cats appear to be less frequently affected by arthropod-borne infectious diseases than dogs and share fewer zoonotic pathogens with man. This impression is supported by the relative lack of scientific publications related to feline vector-borne infections. This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit. A number of simple possibilities might account for the lower prevalence of these diseases in cats, including factors related to the lifestyle and behaviour of the cat, lesser spend on preventative healthcare for cats and reduced opportunities for research funding for these animals. The dog and cat have substantially similar immune system components, but differences in immune function might in part account for the markedly distinct prevalence and clinicopathological appearance of autoimmune, allergic, idiopathic inflammatory, immunodeficiency, neoplastic and infectious diseases in the two species. Cats have greater genetic diversity than dogs with much lower linkage disequilibrium in feline compared with canine breed groups. Immune function is intrinsically related to the nature of the intestinal microbiome and subtle differences between the canine and feline microbial populations might also impact on immune function and disease resistance. The reasons for the apparent lesser susceptibility of cats to arthropod-borne infectious diseases are likely to be complex, but warrant further investigation.	Although dogs and cats largely share equivalent immune systems, there are clear differences between the species as to how the elements of the immune system interactcreating species diversity in susceptibility to, and clinicopathological expression of, immunemediated, neoplastic and infectious diseases. No simple immunological model can summarize these differences in immune function, but immunity might be regulated by distinct genetic backgrounds and potentially by differences in the intestinal microbiome in dogs and cats. If cats are really less susceptible than dogs to arthropod-borne infectious diseases, it remains possible that such resistance relates to differential immune function. However, there are still much simpler explanations that might account for the species difference in occurrence of vector-borne diseases and much work is still required to characterize more accurately the true prevalence and clinical significance of these infections in the cat. |

Viral transmission occurs directly or indirectly via fomites. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and viability of FCV in the environment after sequential oronasal infections of specified pathogen-free cats with two FCV field strains in a research facility. Replicating virus was detected in saliva swabs from all ten cats after the first and in four out of ten cats after the second FCV exposure using virus isolation to identify FCV shedders. In the environment, where cleaning, but no disinfection took place, FCV viral RNA was detectable using RT-qPCR on all tested items and surfaces, including cat hair. However, only very limited evidence was found of replicating virus using virus isolation. Viral RNA remained demonstrable for at least 28 days after shedding had ceased in all cats. Disinfection with 5% sodium bicarbonate (and Incidin TM Plus) and barrier measures were effective in that no viral RNA was detectable outside the cat rooms. Our findings are important for any multicat environment to optimize hygienic measures against FCV infection.	Veterinarians and animal hospital managers should be aware of the vast contamination potential of FCV, although the persistence of FCV in the environment might be strain-dependent. Each cat suspected to be infected with FCV should be treated as possibly highly infectious for other cats, and appropriate hygienic measurements should be applied. In our study, disinfection with 5% sodium bicarbonate, in combination with barrier measures, worked well. |

Livestock industries need to significantly expand to ensure adequate protein supply for the growing and more affluent human populations. To increase animal production, various measures were undertaken including expanding agricultural areas and increasing diversity of livestock production systems. Unfortunately these acts are often not supported by increasing environmental and public health regulations in this region. Increased animal movement across borders through legal and illegal trade will continue to occur as long as there is surplus demand for animal proteins. Without harmonization of regional disease controls and strengthening of veterinary disease control programs, emerging disease especially those that had been neglected will continue to threaten regional livestock industry. Deforestation and fragmentation of ecological niches in an effort to expand agriculture land have significantly benefited the local and regional economy and improved society's wealth. However, without doubt these activities are associated with emerging and reemerging infection of production animals in this region. Many infectious diseases in humans originated from animals and agricultural expansion and intensification/diversification promotes disease emergence through ecosystem-livestockhuman interface. In addition, encroachments of livestock into wild animal habitat enhance disease transmission at livestockwildlife interface. The spread of these infections would threaten regional food security and safety. Emerging zoonoses causes major losses through reduced economic activity directly from trade restriction that is often prompted by a nation's precautionary behavior. The ripple effect from reduction in economic activity can spread to other livestock-related sectors at the national and international levels. Emerging and reemerging infection causes additional cost to the country through general precautionary and preventive measures such as establishment of quarantine station and procedures, restriction of animal importation, premovement testing, vaccination, surveillance, and monitoring. Tremendous downturn in livestock-affiliated economic activity and shock to livelihoods of those affected by the disease warrant collaborative interministrial and intersectoral efforts at national and international level to minimize emerging diseases in livestock and humans.|

Four of the calves originated from one farm and this was the farm on which the outbreak of calf dysentery had occurred ; the fifth calf originated from a separate outbreak. Two other calves were examined from the farm on which the former outbreak of calf dysentery occurred. Lesions were detected in the large intestines of these calves which were indistinguishable from those described in association with enteropathogenic E coli (Hall et a11985) , but the bacteria were not E coli (S102-9). The nature of the adherent bacteria in the other seven calves is unknown, and their role in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea is unclear. It is possible that, because they always occurred in association with other enteropathogens, their presence was the result of an altered bacterial flora, following diarrhoea caused by another enteropathogen, or by the use of antibiotics. Alternatively, they may have contributed to the pathogenesis of diarrhoea by colonising the mucosal surface of the large intestine, causing lesions and inhibiting absorptive function. The lesions with which they were associated were identical in nature to those seen in the four calves infected by the confirmed enteropathogen E coli (S102-9) , although the severity was variable; this suggests a pathogenic role for these unidentified bacteria which may be confirmed by isolation and identification of the bacteria involved and studies of experimental infections.|

At 1.2-μM concentration, lycorine reduced viral titers of West Nile (WNV), dengue, and yellow fever viruses by 10 2 -to 10 4 -fold. However, the compound did not inhibit an alphavirus (Western equine encephalitis virus) or a rhabdovirus (vesicular stomatitis virus), indicating a selective antiviral spectrum. The compound exerts its antiviral activity mainly through suppression of viral RNA replication. A Val → Met substitution at the 9th amino acid position of the viral 2K peptide (spanning the endoplasmic reticulum membrane between NS4A and NS4B proteins) confers WNV resistance to lycorine, through enhancement of viral RNA replication. Initial chemistry synthesis demonstrated that modifications of the two hydroxyl groups of lycorine can increase the compound's potency, while reducing its cytotoxicity. Taken together, the results have established lycorine as a flavivirus inhibitor for antiviral development. The lycorine-resistance results demonstrate a direct role of the 2K peptide in flavivirus RNA synthesis.	Both genome-length RNA and replicon RNA were in vitro transcribed from corresponding cDNA plasmids that were linearized with XbaI. A T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) was used for RNA synthesis described before (Shi et al., 2002a) . Both replicon and genome-length RNAs were electroporated into BHK-21 cells as described above. For transfection of genome-length RNA, culture fluids were collected every 24 h until apparent cytopathic effect was observed (day 4 to day 5 post-transfection). The viruses in the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80°C.|

Abstract J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Objectives: On March 15, 2020, 61.3% of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection are associated with the worship service that was organized on February 9 in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, South	"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of mass infection due to temporal increases in contacts and assess the preventive control interventions using the confirmed cases and deaths data associated with COVID-19 in Korea. The first patient was reported on January 20, 2020, but the transmission of the infection actually started from the 3rd confirmed patients from January 22 in Korea. Since then, the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea has resulted in 29 confirmed cases by February 18. In addition, it appeared that the outbreak was going to be controlled. It was shown that 0 = 1.77 in our model analysis. This is slightly lower than that of Wuhan, China ( 0 = 2.24~3.58) (Zhao et al. 2020) . Personal hygiene, such as wearing masks, handwashing and disinfecting items, seemed to have been maintained a certain level, Thus far, the COVID-19 outbreak is ongoing in many countries. For example, as of March 23, 2020, countries such as Italy, the United States, Spain, Germany, and France still have more than 3,000 confirmed cases per day and more than 100 deaths per day. However, in Korea, the outbreak has been reduced, as confirmed by the value of to less than unity within 10 days after the first mass infection was noticed. Accordingly, we suggest that the government policy of ""social distancing"" which had been implemented in Korea until April 5 and extended to May 5 may be maintained even at a lower level. |"

However, high-quality evidence to inform management is scarce. Oral amoxycillin-clavulanate is often the first antibiotic chosen for non-severe respiratory exacerbations, because of the antibiotic-susceptibility patterns detected in the respiratory pathogens commonly associated with bronchiectasis. Azithromycin has a prolonged half-life, and with its unique anti-bacterial, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, presents an attractive alternative. Our proposed study will test the hypothesis that oral azithromycin is non-inferior (within a 20% margin) to amoxycillin-clavulanate at achieving resolution of non-severe respiratory exacerbations by day 21 of treatment in children with non-CF bronchiectasis.

Although cessation of elective surgical procedures has forced an unprecedented amount of ''downtime,'' adherence to a specific protocol has allowed for OMS services to continue for those patients for whom our unique training and services are most needed. It has also allowed us, as oralmaxillofacial surgeons, with our excellent training in anesthesia and management of critically ill and trauma patients, to be an asset to our clinical facilities should our expertise be required elsewhere. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen, it remains our duty to continue to provide emergency services, be excellent stewards of existing healthcare resources, and mitigate the risk of our healthcare system becoming overwhelmed and exhausted of resources.|
472	170eb018c43083eef1333bc6ff6ffd95d19a9a96	Differences in the epidemiology and virology of mild, severe and fatal human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus	A novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus caused 5-10 % mild and 30.5 % fatal human infections as of December 10, 2015. In order to investigate the reason for the higher rate of fatal outcome of this infection, this study compared the molecular epidemiology and virology of avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses from mild (N = 14), severe (N = 50) and fatal (N = 35) cases, as well as from nonhuman hosts (N = 73). The epidemiological results showed that the average age of the people in the mild, severe and fatal groups was 27.6, 52 and 62 years old, respectively (p \ 0.001). Males accounted for 42.9 % (6/14), 58.0 % (29/50), and 74.3 % (26/35) of cases in the mild, severe and fatal group respectively (p = 0.094). Median days from onset to start of antiviral treatment were 2, 5 and 7 days in the mild, severe and fatal group, respectively (p = 0.002). The median time from onset to discharge/death was 12, 40 and 19 days in the mild, severe and fatal group, respectively (p \ 0.001). Analysis of whole genome sequences showed that PB2 (E627K), NA (R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations were markedly associated with an increased fatality rate, while HA (N276D) and PB2 (N559T) mutations were clearly related to mild cases. There were no differences in the genotypes, adaptation to mammalian hosts, and genetic identity between the three types of infection. In conclusion, advanced age and delayed confirmation of diagnosis and antiviral intervention were risk factors for death. Furthermore, PB2 (E627K), NA (R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations might contribute to a fatal outcome in human H7N9 infection.	In conclusion, advanced age, as well as a delay in confirmation of diagnosis and start of antiviral treatment, were the greatest contributory factors to a high risk of death. Furthermore, PB2 (E627K), NA(R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations were slightly associated with an increased fatality rate. However, HA (N276D) and PB2 (N559T) were obviously related to a mild outcome. Although H7N9 isolates from all over the world presented with a variety of genotypes, there were no sequence differences in the mild, severe and fatal cases. However, there was an obvious difference in the distribution of genotypes in the regions of the Pearl and Yangtze rivers and between the three different epidemic waves. There was also evidence to suggest that genetic tuning not only mediated species switching but may also have allowed the virus to increase its adaptation to more efficiently infect humans and enable person-to-person transmission [28, 43] . However, the mechanism driving genetic tuning has not yet been fully elucidated, and no vaccine for the prevention of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection is available to date. Thus, an effective avian influenza surveillance network for discovering new infections and monitoring any genetic changes and potential adaptations in the H7N9 virus at the early stages is essential. Canada recently reported two confirmed family cases of influenza A (H7N9), imported from China. This showed that it is possible to transfer the H7N9 virus from China to the rest of the world via travel and transportation [35] . Close cooperation between the different sectors related to human health, poultry and wild birds is necessary to respond to the potential pandemic risk posed by the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses [8] .|

However, serum sickness and anaphylaxis limited its broad application. The advancement of antibody engineering technologies has made it feasible to generate monoclonal antibodies. There are divergent methods for antibody engineering and optimization. In this chapter, we summarized the latest developments in engineering antibodies for infectious diseases.	"In the era of antibiotic resistance, antibody-based therapy holds great promise in treating infectious pathogens. It is a holy grail to produce human antibodies with high therapeutic efficacy. The therapeutic potential of antibodies is derived from less immunogenicity, proper serum circulating time, high antigen-binding affinity, exquisite specificity and robust effector function. Advancement in antibody engineering technolo-gies makes it possible to produce antibodies tailored to different infection pathogens. Over the past decades, the ""magic bullet"" has obtained fruitful success in a wide range of diseases including tumors, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions. However, in the field of infections, there is a gap between preclinical researches and clinical applications. Many engineered antibodies are still making their way through preclinical/clinical tests, only few are approved for market. Here, we provided a review of technologies for antibody engineering and optimization. We are optimistic about the application of engineered antibodies to treat infectious pathogens. With the emergence of new infectious pathogens and multidrug resistant bacterial, engineered antibodies may offer another choice to combat these threats. |"

475	efd0db816c414f8900dac9b53bc6a89da90fd00a	Molecular Characterization of Ebselen Binding Activity to SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease	The Coronavirus Disease pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against this new virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs that have already been approved for various diseases as potent Mpro inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme's catalytic site. By relying on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro's catalytic activity. Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region localized between the II and III domains of the protein.	The absolute binding free energy is defined as: ΔGbinding=ΔG L -ΔG RL , where ΔG RL is the free energy change of Ebselen annihilation in the Mpro complex, and ΔG L is the free energy change of Ebselen annihilation in water. To calculate these free energy changes, we use Thermodynamic Integration (TI) implemented in PMEMD for Amber 18. We use the one step anhihilation protocol with soft core potentials (34) . In addition, we adopted a simple approach with multiple runs starting from the most probably binding cluster estimated from previous MD simulations. In this way, three independent replicas for each site were taken into account, as well as three replicas for Ebselen solvated in pure water. Eleven equally spaced windows were used (ΔLambda=0.1) with 10ns of simulation time per window. To keep the ligand from wandering in TI calculations, we used a soft restraint of 10 kcal/molÅ 2 (35) .|

These surface molecules associated with immune function were either induced (Class II) or upregulated (Class I and ICAM-1) on cultured retinal glial cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner following exposure to recombinant interferon-y (rIFN-y). MI-K Class I and II expression by passaged and primary cells was maximal (> 90% positive) after incubation with 100 U/ml of rIFN-y for 48 h. ICAM-I expression by primary and passaged cells tripled between 48 and 72 h after exposure to 25 or 50 U/ml of rIFN-y. By 72 h after exposure to 100 U/ml of rIFN-y, 62% of the retinal glia were positive for ICAM-1, whereas under normal culture conditions these molecules were detected on < 3% of the retinal glia. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known stimulator of central nervous system (CNS) astrocytes, increased ICAM-expression only 3-fold to 9% of cells staining positively, but neither MHC Class I nor Class II expression was altered from baseline levels. Surface expression of ICAM-1, MHC Class I, and MHC Class II was unaffected by exposure to either rTNF-a (1000 U/ml) or rIL-6 (100 U/ml> for 24 h. Under normal culture conditions, intracellular interleukind (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were detected immunohistochemically. Exposure to either rIFN-y or LPS induced more intense staining which correlated with increased secreted levels of both cytokines in culture supematants. Levels of secreted TNF-a increased 6-fold after stimulation with LPS for 24 h, while secreted IL-6 increased over 9-fold. These results support the hypothesis that retinal glia may participate in intraretinal immune processes following stimulation during inflammatory and infectious processes via either cell surface-or soluble mediator-dependent mechanisms or a combination of both.	Both IL-6 and TNF-(r have known roles in the rescue of photoreceptor cells during retinal degeneration in the Royal College of Surgeons rat (LaVai et al., 1992) . These cytokines also have opposing roles in induction of apoptosis (e.g. Smith et al., 1994) . Thus, retinal Mliller cells may play a role in maintenance of normal retinal integrity via their secretion of TNFcr, IL-6, and other soluble mediators commonly associated with immunological function. The dynamics of surface marker modulation and altered cytokine secretion by Miller cells in these normal and pathological retinal processes remain to be elucidated. Studies are in progress to further define the key functions of these cells in intraocular immune responses.|

Many species groups and unplaced species of heroines are still left without a generic name following the revision of the genus Cichlasoma. We describe here the ÔCichlasoma' facetum group as a new genus, Australoheros, and provide evidence for its monophyly based on phylogenetic analyses of morphological and mtDNA characters. Australoheros is morphologically characterized by the lowest values in meristic characters among heroines and by three apomorphic characters in coloration pattern. In addition to the three described species of Australoheros, our results of species delimitation based on a combination of tree-and character-based approaches identify seven putatively new species of Australoheros. Several coding schemes of morphological characters are used to recover the intrageneric relationships within the genus, resulting in very similar topologies. Discovery of additional species within the genus is expected once material from the whole distribution area is studied.	Identifikation von Arten der ÔCichlasoma' facetum Gruppe mit der Berschreibung einer neuen Gattung Die ÔCichlasoma' facetum Gruppe ist eine der zahlreichen Artengruppen von Amerikanischen Buntbarschen der taxonomisch komplizierten Gruppe der Heroini. Viele Artengruppen der Heroinen haben keinen stabilen Gattungsnamen nach der Revision der Gattung Cichlasoma. Wir beschreiben diese Artengruppe als neue Gattung, Australoheros, und demonstrieren ihre Monophylie anhand einer phylogenetischen Analyse von morphologischen und mtDNA Merkmalen. Morphologisch ist Australoheros durch die niedrigsten meristischen Werte innerhalb der Heroini sowie durch drei apomorphe Merkmale gekennzeichnet. Die Kombination verschiedener Verfahren der Merkmalsanalyse ermo¨glicht die Identifikation von sieben weiteren Arten neben den drei bereits beschriebenen dieser Artengruppe. Durch verschiedene Kodierungsschemata der morphologischen Merkmale entwickeln wir eine phylogenetische Hypothese der Verwandt-schaftsverha¨ltnisse der Arten innerhalb von Australoheros und zeigen, dass verschiedene Kodierungen zu sehr a¨hnlichen Topologien fu¨hren.|

Like parental viruses, VLPs can be either non-enveloped or enveloped, and they can form following expression of one or several viral structural proteins in a recombinant heterologous system. Depending on the complexity of the VLP, it can be produced in either a prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression system using target-encoding recombinant vectors, or in some cases can be assembled in cell-free conditions. To date, a wide variety of VLP-based candidate vaccines targeting various viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal pathogens, as well as non-infectious diseases, have been produced in different expression systems. Some VLPs have entered clinical development and a few have been licensed and commercialized. This article reviews VLP-based vaccines produced in different systems, their immunogenicity in animal models and their status in clinical development.	Additionally, VLPs offer an economic approach to producing SUVs. Several recombinant systems have been successfully used for VLP production, with promising efficacy reported for many of these VLP vaccine candidates. Thus, VLPs produced in recombinant systems are anticipated to be very prominent among approaches to commercialize further SUVs.|

However, clinical characteristics of HPIV coinfection with other pathogens were unclear. This study aimed to investigate the viral and atypical bacterial etiology of LRTI in children and compare the clinical characteristics of HPIV single infection with those of coinfection. Methods: This study included 1335 patients, aged between 1 to 71 months, diagnosed with LRTI in Yuying Childrenʼs Hospital, Zhejiang, China, from December 2013 to June 2015. Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected, and respiratory pathogens were detected using Multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The clinical data of patients were collected and analyzed.	Several studies focused on the association between the severity of illness and coinfection, but no consensus has been reached. Some studies showed that viral coinfection did not increase severity, 17, 23 some studies indicated that virus single infection increased the risk of severe situations, 24 Laboratory examination PCT＞0.5 ng/mL 6 (9.7) 3 (6.7) 0 (0) The unit for peak and bottom of WBC was 10 9 /L; the normal value was 4-12 × 10 9 /L. d The unit for CRP was mg/L; the normal value was 0-8 mg/L. e Leukocytosis was defined as WBC more than 12 × 10 9 /L. f CRP increase was defined as CRP more than 8 mg/L. g Leukopenia was defined as WBC less than 4 × 10 9 /L. The quantitative data were expressed as median(quartile). The count data were expressed as numbers (%) of each group. |
481	6a0ba0f6bf7aba9ebd394ede960c770843e6a531	Human parainfluenza virus type 2 V protein inhibits interferon production and signaling and is required for replication in non-human primates	In wild-type human parainfluenza virus type 2 (WT HPIV2), one gene (the P/V gene) encodes both the polymerase-associated phosphoprotein (P) and the accessory V protein. We generated a HPIV2 virus (rHPIV2-V ko ) in which the P/V gene encodes only the P protein to examine the role of V in replication in vivo and as a potential live attenuated virus vaccine. Preventing expression of V protein severely impaired virus recovery from cDNA and growth in vitro, particularly in IFN-competent cells. rHPIV2-V ko , unlike WT HPIV2, strongly induced IFN-β and permitted IFN signaling, leading to establishment of a robust antiviral state. rHPIV2-V ko infection induced extensive syncytia and cytopathicity that was due to both apoptosis and necrosis. Replication of rHPIV2-V ko was highly restricted in the respiratory tract of African green monkeys and in differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, suggesting that V protein is essential for efficient replication of HPIV2 in organized epithelial cells and that rHPIV2-V ko is over-attenuated for use as a live attenuated vaccine.	Prior to inoculation with rHPIV2, the apical surfaces of HAE were rinsed with PBS to remove apical surface secretions and fresh medium was supplied to the basolateral compartments. HAE cultures were inoculated with rHPIV2s at low MOI (0.01 TCID 50 /cell) in 200-μl inocula applied to the apical surface, and the cultures were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The apical surfaces of the cultures were then rinsed 3 × 5 min with PBS and returned to the 37°C incubator.

IAV infection was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy slowed fusion of IAV with endosomes and reduced activation of interferon signalling. This was consistent with conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showing that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leukocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy pathways in airway epithelial 20 cells as a novel innate defence mechanism that can restrict IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.	Sub-confluent monolayers of MEFs were incubated with dual-labelled (SP-DiOC18/R18) IAV at 4 0 C for 45 min and warmed to 37°C for 90 min. pH-dependent fusion was assessed by adding bafilomycin A1 (BAF) to some wells. Cells were harvested by trypsinisation, fixed in PFA and analysed by flow cytometry. |

The ELISA is very similar to the VNT with respect to sensitivity and specificity but is much quicker and cheaper to perform . Export certification involves processing large numbers of sera concomitantly and the semi-automation that can be achieved using the ELISA technique would be a considerable benefit . For differential diagnosis, this ELISA could be used in conjunction with a TGE-specific test and indeed with minimal modification both could be performed side by side on the same antigen coated plate . Since the mAb 6A .C3 is directed towards an epitope that is highly conserved amongst TGEV/ PRCVs, the risk of false negative results due to antigenic diversity amongst these viruses appears to be low .|

The goal of this review is to provide an overview on how microglia respond to bacterial pathogens targeting the brain, how the interplay between microglia and bacteria can be studied experimentally, and possible ways to use gained knowledge to identify novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. We discuss the dual role of microglia in disease development, the beneficial functions crucial for bacterial clearing, and the destructive properties through triggering neuroinflammation, characterized by cytokine and chemokine release which leads to leukocyte trafficking through the brain vascular endothelium and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier integrity. Due to intrinsic complexity of microglia and up until recently lack of specific markers, the study of microglial response to bacterial pathogens is challenging. New experimental models and techniques open up possibilities to accelerate progress in the field. We review existing models and discuss possibilities and limitations. Finally, we summarize recent findings where bacterial virulence factors are identified to be important for the microglial response, and how manipulation of evoked responses could be used for therapeutic or preventive purposes. Among promising approaches are: modulations of microglia phenotype switching toward anti-inflammatory and phagocytic functions, the use of non-bacterolytic antimicrobials, preventing release of bacterial components into the neural milieu and consequential amplification of immune activation, and protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity.

Microglia and perivascular cells were found to ingest large amounts of myelin degradation products, while expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Activation of perivascular macrophages, as indicated by increased class II expression, lasted for many years and appeared to follow down-regulation of both phagocytic activity and class II expression on parenchymal microglia. TUNEL labeling was absent from both microglia and perivascular cells at all time points investigated. Indirect evidence is presented that microglia may transfer myelin degradation products to the perivascular space. Perivascular cells which express MHC class II molecules constitutively do not appear to leave the perivascular compartment in large numbers and could release myelin degradation products into the cerebrospinal fluid. The possible immunological con-sequences of these findings are discussed with respect to their possible relevance for antigen presentation and autoimmune central nervous system disease.	Phagocytosis is one of the strongest stimuli for microglial cells to express MHC class II molecules which are of crucial importance for antigen-dependent T cell responses [3, 4] . It has been previously demonstrated that sites of direct and indirect brain injury acquire a predisposition for the development of autoimmune inflammatory lesions [19, 24] . Even in the absence of breakdown of the blood-brain barrier [15, 29] , autoimmune encephalomyelitic lesions can be targeted to CNS tissue undergoing Wallerian degeneration [19] . However, Wallerian degeneration is not normally followed by autoimmune attack. Thus, the CNS must be somehow protected against unwanted presentation of myelin-associated antigens to T lymphocytes [36] . Recent studies have shown that in addition to MHC class II molecules, co-stimulatory factors such as B7 are required to confer complete antigen-presenting capacity to MHC class II expressing cells, which are then able to stimulate a proliferative T cell response [5, 35] . Since the expression of co-stimulatory molecules has been described in multiple sclerosis lesions but not in neurodegenerative conditions [1, 5] , we speculate that co-stimulatory factors may be absent from lipophages during Wallerian degeneration and that antigen presentation, if it occurs, may lead to T cell anergy rather than proliferation [9, 32] . Clearly, secondary rather than primary T cell responses should be considered in this context [33] . In the light of this hypothesis, the very slow breakdown of CNS myelin and the associated expression of class II molecules may confer a biological advantage and help to maintain the immune privilege of the CNS. Similarly, the well-established low threshold of microglia and perivascular cells for the up-regulation of MHC class II molecules could serve a protective function.|

Protease inhibitors (PIs) are very effective and demonstrate highly cooperative dose-response curves, which can be explained by the capacity of these inhibitors to independently affect multiple discrete steps in the viral life cycle, such as entry, RT, and post-reverse transcription steps (Rabi et al. 2013) . In a parallel capacity to PIs, and as we have discussed in our review, NCIs have the potential to affect multiple discrete viral pathways, similar to PIs. We propose that NCIs will have similar properties to PIs in regard to demonstrating highly cooperative dose-response curves. Most importantly, and in contrast to protease, NCIs should not tolerate mutational changes without considerable loss of function. Therefore, the apparent strong genetic barrier necessary for NCI resistance and the fact that NCIs inhibit a viral protein with multiple key functions throughout the HIV-1 life cycle strongly supports the continued research on identifying and optimizing NCIs as well as investigations into their antiviral mechanisms.|

The IHR name the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) as one of the international organisations with whom the WHO must cooperate and co-ordinate in implementing the IHR. It was organisations like the IFRC and MSF, that worked to stop the spread of Ebola following the outbreak in 2014. The focus of this chapter is the work of the IFRC during the Ebola outbreak. The IFRC carries out relief operations to assist victims of disasters, and combines this with development work to strengthen the capacities of its member National Societies. The IFRC's work focuses on four core areas: promoting humanitarian values, disaster response, disaster preparedness, and health and community care. Combining a study of the IFRC as an organisation with a legal mandate of its own, elucidated in the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and the more general international legal framework, this chapter uses international law as a framework to reflect on the limits and effectiveness of legal measures in responding to Ebola. To this end, international law provides a logical and global method to respond to infectious diseases. This chapter finds that the mandate and practice of the IFRC in the response to Ebola provides material to critically analyse each of these parts in light of infectious disease proliferation in 2014-2016. Since outbreak was announced in early 2014 more than 10,000 Red Cross volunteers were trained in Ebola response. IFRC supported emergency operations in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have targeted 23 million people.	Ultimately, this chapter has shown the nuanced and complex relationship between the Red Cross Movement and the WHO. As two actors with international mandates concerning health, they have very different roles. The international community should not be aiming for an ultimate coordinating body to oversee the entire response as organisations have grown up independently of one another and have unique and established relationships with the states and communities that they may serve. Of course, on the international stage, delegates may converse, build relationships, discuss operations, but that it not to say that the best practice would come from an ultimate authority dictating the actions of all possible responders. This is particularly the case with the IFRC and National Societies which have built and nurtured relationships with States and each other for decades in order to develop institutional best practice. The autonomy of the Red Cross to react to an outbreak should be respected and, where beneficial to both the WHO and the Red Cross, it may be part of a multi-institutional operation or response.|

H7N9 originated with multiple reassortment events between avian viruses and carries genetic markers of human adaptation. Determining whether H7N9 induces a host response closer to that with human or avian IAV is important in order to better characterize this emerging virus. Here we compared the human lung epithelial cell response to infection with A/Anhui/ 01/13 (H7N9) or highly pathogenic avian-origin H5N1, H7N7, or human seasonal H3N2 IAV. The transcriptomic response to H7N9 was highly specific to this strain but was more similar to the response to human H3N2 than to that to other avian IAVs. H7N9 and H3N2 both elicited responses related to eicosanoid signaling and chromatin modification, whereas H7N9 specifically induced genes regulating the cell cycle and transcription. Among avian IAVs, the response to H7N9 was closest to that elicited by H5N1 virus. Host responses common to H7N9 and the other avian viruses included the lack of induction of the antigen presentation pathway and reduced proinflammatory cytokine induction compared to that with H3N2. Repression of these responses could have an important impact on the immunogenicity and virulence of H7N9 in humans. Finally, using a genome-based drug repurposing approach, we identified several drugs predicted to regulate the host response to H7N9 that may act as potential antivirals, including several kinase inhibitors, as well as FDA-approved drugs, such as troglitazone and minocycline. Importantly, we validated that minocycline inhibited H7N9 replication in vitro, suggesting that our computational approach holds promise for identifying novel antivirals. IMPORTANCE Whether H7N9 will be the next pandemic influenza virus or will persist and sporadically infect humans from its avian reservoir, similar to H5N1, is not known yet. High-throughput profiling of the host response to infection allows rapid characterization of virus-host interactions and generates many hypotheses that will accelerate understanding and responsiveness to this potential threat. We show that the cellular response to H7N9 virus is closer to that induced by H3N2 than to that induced by H5N1, reflecting the potential of this new virus for adaptation to humans. Importantly, dissecting the host response to H7N9 may guide host-directed antiviral development.

Autoimmunity plays an important role in this pathology outcome and body's own immune system attacks on the myelin sheath causing the damage. The etiology of the disease is partially understood and the response to treatment cannot easily be predicted. Results: We presented the results obtained using 8 genetically predisposed randomly chosen individuals reproducing both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level. For simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. Results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease. Other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved.	MS is a disease that involves practically all the immune system machinery, both at cellular, molecular and sub-molecular level. A detailed model would require a specialized framework and for this reason would be computationally expensive. The current version of Netlogo is probably not suitable to this purpose. We are working in this direction using a general framework for the immune system developed by us for other pathologies. Progress in this direction will be published in due course.|

Smoking has a systemic negative impact on CFTR function. A diagnostic comparison between NPD and ICM and the impact of smoking on both CFTR tests has not been done. Methods: The sweat chloride test, NPD, and ICM were performed in 18 patients with CF (sweat chloride >60 mmol/l), including 6 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients, and 13 healthy controls, including 8 smokers. The NPD CFTR response to Cl-free and isoproterenol perfusion (Δ0Cl − + Iso) was compared to the ICM CFTR response to forskolin/IBMX, carbachol, and histamine (ΔI sc, forskolin/IBMX+ carbachol+histamine ). Results: The mean NPD CFTR response and ICM CFTR response between patients with CF and healthy controls was significantly different (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS and those who were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Smokers have a decreased CFTR response measured by NPD (p = 0.049). For ICM there is a trend towards decreased CFTR response (NS). Three healthy control smokers had NPD responses within the CF-range. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap of the ICM response between patients with CF and controls. Conclusions: ICM is superior to NPD in distinguishing between patients with CF who have a sweat chloride > 60 mmol/l and healthy controls, including smokers. Neither NPD nor ICM differentiated between patients with CF who were PS from those who were PI. Smoking has a negative impact on CFTR function in healthy controls measured by NPD and challenges the diagnostic interpretation of NPD, but not ICM.	Limitations of our study include the small number of participants in each group, the lack of patients with CF with a sweat chloride value < 60 mmol/l, and patients with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). The strength of our study is the genotyping of healthy controls with an abnormal CFTR NPD response, and the use of standardized protocols for sweat testing, NPD, and ICM.

A higher ΔIsc (forskolin/IBMX + carbachol + histamine) represents a better CFTR response.|

Over the last 100 years, the mortality burden of infectious diseases has decreased substantially and the average lifespan has increased by over 30 years due to advances in public health, sanitation, vaccines, and anti-infective chemotherapy -all deriving from the sciences of microbiology and immunology (Centers for Disease Control 1999). Future advances are anticipated when the genomics era in which we now live and the promise of systems biology and personalized medicine are fully realized in the next few decades. A remarkable story of directed inquiry into the fundamental nature of microbes and immune defenses preceded many of the current advances in medicine. Much work remains before the benefits of these discoveries can be applied equally worldwide.|
498	76b09383740476d96a3e63ae0f265e2897e9a194	25 The Domestic Cat, Felis catus, as a Model of Hereditary and Infectious Disease	The domestic cat, currently the most frequent of companion animals, has enjoyed a medical surveillance, as a nonprimate species, second only to the dog. With over 200 hereditary disease pathologies reported in the cat, the clinical and physiological study of these feline hereditary diseases provides a strong comparative medicine opportunity for prevention, diagnostics, and treatment studies in a laboratory setting. Causal mutations have been characterized in 19 felid genes, with the largest representation from lysosomal storage enzyme disorders. Corrective therapeutic strategies for several disorders have been proposed and examined in the cat, including enzyme replacement, heterologous bone marrow transplantation, and substrate reduction therapy. Genomics tools developed in the cat, including the recent completion of the 2-fold whole genome sequence of the cat and genome browser, radiation hybrid map of 1793 integrated coding and microsatellite loci, a 5-cM genetic linkage map, arrayed BAC libraries, and flow sorted chromosomes, are providing resources that are being utilized in mapping and characterization of genes of interest. A recent report of the mapping and characterization of a novel causative gene for feline spinal muscular atrophy marked the first identification of a disease gene purely from positional reasoning. With the development of genomic resources in the cat and the application of complementary comparative tools developed in other species, the domestic cat is emerging as a promising resource of phenotypically defined genetic variation of biomedical significance. Additionally, the cat has provided several useful models for infectious disease. These include feline leukemia and feline sarcoma virus, feline coronavirus, and Type C retroviruses that interact with cellular oncogenes to induce leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma.	The cat has provided several useful models for infectious disease. These include feline leukemia and feline sarcoma virus, feline coronavirus, and Type C retroviruses that interact with cellular oncogenes to induce leukemia, lymphoma, and sarcoma. [130] [131] [132] Historically, many of the human oncogenes that defi ne signal transduction pathways were originally discovered in the context of feline leukemia virus interaction in cat models. The cat provides the only naturally occurring model for human AIDS pathogenesis, in its endemic fatal transmissible feline immunodefi ciency virus (FIV). 133, 134 Similar to its close phylogenetic relative HIV, FIV induces CD4-T lymphocyte depletion in affected cats, an immune system collapse, and susceptibility to adventitious microbial agents as a prelude to wasting disease and death. 133, 135 Interestingly, over 10 wildcat species (including lions, leopards, cheetahs, ocelots, pumas and other big cats) are endemic with their own species-specific strain of FIV [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] ; however, unlike strains in domestic cats, the wildcat FIV strains do not appear to cause acute immunodeficiency in the wildcat species, perhaps a consequence of historic natural selection of host genetic resistance to the fatal virus. 139, 142 Lion and puma-specific FIV strains have recently been demonstrated to utilize novel, more promiscuous mechanisms for cell entry than FIV, suggesting a divergent tropism and biological properties of these viruses. 143 The World Health Organization reported a new human respiratory illness outbreak (severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS) that emerged in Guangdong Province, China in 2003. 144, 145 Sequence analysis demonstrated that the infectious agent was a previously unrecognized coronavirus. 146, 147 An animal model demonstrating clinical symptoms and pathology of SARS-infected patients has not been reported. 148 Of interest, the recent report of a highly virulent feline coronavirus epidemic in captive African cheetahs, a disease model for human SARS, illustrates the critical role of ancestral population genetic variation. 132 In addition, cats injected with the SARS virus developed clinical symptoms, an important insight in implicating the virus in the SARS epidemic. [149] [150] [151] [152] The feline panleukopenia (feline distemper) virus has revealed a natural history parable in its abrupt transformation of the cat virus to an epidemic, fatal canine parvovirus, that emerged in the world's puppy population in 1978. 153 In contrast, the canine distemper virus, which is normally restricted to canid species, precipitously adapted to and decimated East African lions in 1994, killing one-third of the lions in the Serengeti ecosystem within a 9-month outbreak. 154 A clear involvement of host defense mecha- nisms in these and other infectious disease episodes renders the cats and their pathogens an excellent candidate species for characterizing the interaction of microbial adaptation and host disease gene defenses. Given the critical importance of infectious disease in scores of chronic and acute human disease, there are powerful research opportunities in the cat family. 142, 155 Finally, recent concern over the emergence of avian flu H5N1 has shown a strong susceptibility of cats, both domestic and large cats, again raising possibilities for pathogenesis and therapy development. 156, 157 With the development of genomic resources in the cat (Table  25 -2) and the application of complementary comparative tools developed in other species, the domestic cat is emerging as a promising resource of phenotypically defined genetic variation of biomedical significance. Exploration of similar resources in other species, particularly the dog and mouse, has provided important insight into otherwise unexplained biomedical disorders.|

While terrorist acts are the most insidious and onerous of all disruptions, it is obvious that there are many similarities to the way one should deal with these willful acts and those caused by natural and accidental incidents that have also resulted in adverse and severe consequences. However, there is one major and critical difference between terrorist acts and the other types of disruptions: the terrorist acts are willful -and therefore also adaptive, if not coordinated. One must counter these acts with the same, if not more sophisticated, willful, adaptive and informed approach. Real-time, information-based decision making -which Tien (2003) has called the decision informatics paradigm -is the approach advanced herein to help make the right decisions at the various stages of a disruption. It is focused on decisions and based on multiple data sources, data fusion and analysis methods, timely information, stochastic decision models and a systems engineering outlook; moreover, it is multidisciplinary, evolutionary and systemic in practice. The approach provides a consistent way to address real-time emergency issues, including those concerned with the preparation for a major disruption, the prediction of such a disruption, the prevention or mitigation of the disruption, the detection of the disruption, the response to the disruption, and the recovery steps that are necessary to adequately, if not fully, recuperate from the disruption. The efforts of the U. S. Department of Homeland Security and its academically-based Homeland Security Centers of Excellence are considered within the proposed types, stages and decisions framework.	The purpose of this paper, then, is to augur for the development of decision technologies that can be employed to prepare for a major disruption, if not predict and possibly prevent the disruption. Such technologies should also detect the disruption, identify the responses required to deal with the resultant situation, and then, following the disruption, specify the recovery steps that are necessary to satisfactorily recuperate from the disruption.|

However, the selection of siRNA-resistant viruses is a major concern in the use of RNAi as antiviral therapeutics. In this study, we conducted a lentiviral vector with a H1-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassette to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into mammalian cells. Using this vector that also expresses enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as surrogate marker, stable shRNAexpressing cell lines were successfully established and the inhibition efficiencies of rationally designed siRNAs targeting to conserved regions of influenza A virus genome were assessed. The results showed that a siRNA targeting influenza M2 gene (siM2) potently inhibited viral replication. The siM2 was not only effective for H1N1 virus but also for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In addition to its M2 inhibition, the siM2 also inhibited NP mRNA accumulation and protein expression. A long term inhibition effect of the siM2 was demonstrated and the emergence of siRNA-resistant mutants in influenza quasispecies was not observed. Taken together, our study suggested that M2 gene might be an optimal RNAi target for antiviral therapy. These findings provide useful information for the development of RNAi-based prophylaxis and therapy for human influenza virus infection.	Found at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0005671.s001 (0.03 MB DOC)|

This work is concerned with nonparametric, closed-end testing procedures based on differences of empirical distribution functions that are designed to be particularly sensitive to changes in the comtemporary distribution of multivariate time series. The proposed detectors are adaptations of statistics used in a posteriori (offline) change-point testing and involve a weighting allowing to give more importance to recent observations. The resulting sequential change-point detection procedures are carried out by comparing the detectors to threshold functions estimated through resampling such that the probability of false alarm remains approximately constant over the monitoring period. A generic result on the asymptotic validity of such a way of estimating a threshold function is stated. As a corollary, the asymptotic validity of the studied sequential tests based on empirical distribution functions is proven when these are carried out using a dependent multiplier bootstrap for multivariate time series. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the good finite-sample properties of the resulting procedures. The application of the derived sequential tests is illustrated on financial data.	i 3 ,m ξ 1) for the procedure based on T m,q with γ ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.5} and p ∈ {1, 2, 4} when based on the dependent multliplier bootstrap with B = 2000.

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that MS is a multi-factorial disease, which develops as a result of host genetics, immune response and environment. Several lines of evidence, including the documentation of microbes which induce a variety of demyelinating diseases in both humans and animals suggest that a virus may comprise the environmental component in the etiology of this disorder. While many viruses have been proposed as etiologic agents in MS, none of these viruses have been firmly associated with disease pathogenesis. Additionally, mechanism(s) by which virus-host interactions may lead to demyelination are not fully understood. Currently, HHV-6 and C. pneumoniae are receiving much attention as potential MS ""triggers"". However, the role of these infectious agents in the pathogenesis of MS is unclear. We suggest that multiple agents may induce a virus-specific and/or a cross-reactive autoimmune process resulting in clinical disease in a subset of genetically susceptible individuals. The involvement of multiple infectious agents in MS, as suggested originally by Dr. Pierre Marie over 100 years ago [40] , may explain the difficulty in identifying a single agent responsible for this highly variable and chronic disease. Moreo-ver, we encourage extreme caution in attempts to readily associate viruses in a chronic, progressive neurologic disorder such as MS. As outlined in this review, it is difficult to determine cause from effect particularly when a ubiquitous agent is suggested to play a role in disease pathogenesis. Uniformity in assay design, viral isolation techniques, molecular probes, etc. must be employed by different research groups on a large number of MS cohorts to confirm these virus associations.|"
505	b038649d067d8136ea0e3019e30fe44dab1fb79b		The emergence of Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel orthobunyavirus, in ruminants in Europe triggered a joint veterinary and public health response to address the possible consequences to human health. Use of a risk profi ling algorithm enabled the conclusion that the risk for zoonotic transmission of SBV could not be excluded completely. Self-reported health problems were monitored, and a serologic study was initiated among persons living and/or working on SBV-affected farms. In the study set-up, we addressed the vector and direct transmission routes for putative zoonotic transfer. In total, 69 sheep farms, 4 goat farms, and 50 cattle farms were included. No evidence for SBV-neutralizing antibodies was found in serum of 301 participants. The lack of evidence for zoonotic transmission from either syndromic illness monitoring or serologic testing of presumably highly exposed persons suggests that the public health risk for SBV, given the current situation, is absent or extremely low.	Current data suggest that infections might have been cleared by the time of delivery, particularly in cattle, which have longer gestations. Furthermore, fi nding RNA in birth materials does not give any information about the actual presence of infectious virus particles in these materials. Attempts to isolate viruses from such specimens have met with little success, and further research is needed to address the issue of infectivity of birth materials. This lack of virus isolation implies that the number of persons in this study directly exposed to infectious virus particles from affected animals and/or birth material might be lower than assumed on the basis of the number of participants reporting this exposure. Nevertheless, the lack of seropositive samples indicates that the risk for infection through contact with contaminated materials, regardless of whether they contain infectious virus particles, is minimal. Therefore, given the high seroprevalence of SBV in affected herds (51 in online Technical Appendix), the lack of any evidence for zoonotic transmission from either the syndromic monitoring or this serologic study suggests that the public health risk for SBV given the current situation is absent or extremely low.|

Within S the receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV host cell receptor. Both S and the RBD are highly immunogenic and both have been found to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Reported here is the X-ray crystal structure of the RBD in complex with the Fab of a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody, F26G19, elicited by immunization with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV. The RBD-F26G19 Fab complex represents the first example of the structural characterization of an antibody elicited by an immune response to SARS-CoV or any fragment of it. The structure reveals that the RBD surface recognized by F26G19 overlaps significantly with the surface recognized by ACE2 and, as such, suggests that F26G19 likely neutralizes SARS-CoV by blocking the virus-host cell interaction.

RNA interference is a novel approach showing promise for therapeutic use in outbreak situations. This study examined the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on clinical signs as well as the presence of live virus and viral DNA in nasal secretions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in horses experimentally infected with EHV-1. siRNA targeting two EHV-1 genes (glycoprotein B and the origin binding protein) was administered 12 h before and 12 h after intranasal infection with EHV-1. Control horses received siRNA targeting firefly luciferase. A significantly smaller proportion (0/10) of horses receiving siRNA targeting viral genes required euthanasia due to intractable neurologic disease as compared to horses in the control group (3/4; p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the presence of live virus or viral DNA in the nasal secretions or PBMCs between the two groups. Future studies are necessary to define the relative contributions of host and virus factors in the development of the neurological form of the infection and to determine an optimal dosing regimen for metaphylactic or therapeutic use of siRNA for treating EHV-1 infection.

510	b4cffa31f2b85e850cda4ce7d07ca56739bddf39	Regulation of virus-triggered type I interferon signaling by cellular and viral proteins	Host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize invading viral pathogens and initiate a series of signaling cascades that lead to the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. During the past decade, significant progresses have been made to characterize PRRs such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TLR-and RLR-mediated signaling. To avoid excessive and harmful immune effects caused by over-activation of these signaling pathways, host cells adopt a number of strategies to regulate them. In addition, invading viruses also employ a variety of mechanisms to inhibit the production of type I IFNs, thereby evading the supervision and clearance by the host. In this review, we briefly summarize the TLR-and RLR-mediated type I IFN signaling and then focus on the mechanisms by which host cellular and viral components regulate the expression of type I IFNs.	Just as host and virus exert selective pressure on each other, studies on hosts and investigations of viruses mutually facilitate our understandings about each other. Future studies will focus on systemic mechanisms by which hosts balance the expression of antiviral and inflammatory cytokines and the translation of viral evasion into benefit of human health. First, mice with deletion of some cellular negative regulators show resistance to viral infection and high viability, while mice defective in others are susceptible to viral infection-caused inflammatory responses. As a result, it is important to take a systemic view of the host regulators when using in vivo mouse models. Second, much more efforts are needed to direct in vivo studies relevant to humans. For example, TLR3 deficiency does not impair the host immune response to several viruses (Edelmann et al., 2004) . Later, it was reported that TLR-deficient mice are more resistant to WNV infection . However, patients with mutations in TLR3 are related to HSV-associated encephalitis . Finally, development of therapeutic drugs that targets cellular or viral inhibitors may provide new strategy to treat infection or immune dysfunction-caused diseases.|
511	6f6e4ab0d6f5fca090211b588154bddc26e6f1ba	Advances in structure- assisted antiviral discovery for animal viral diseases		Protein structure-based drug design has been contributing to the drug discovery process since the early 1990s. This structural knowledge of interaction between drugs and the target protein has been applied mainly to predict potency changes of chemically modified lead compounds. With the help of 3D-structural information, additional aspects of the drug discovery process have become predictable. Selectivity of compounds between homologous or orthologous proteins can be predicted. This provides new possibilities to design selective compounds or predict the suitability of animal models for pharmacodynamic studies. Antivirals display a variety of mechanisms of action. Antivirals may enhance the animal immune system or block a specific enzyme or a particular step in the viral replication cycle. As viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that use the host's cellular machinery to survive and multiply, it is essential that antivirals do not harm the host. However, a major concern is that viruses are continually developing new antiviral resistant strains due to their high mutation rate. This demands for mandatory search or development of new antiviral compounds. With the help of structure-based drug designing, there is progress in preclinical drug discovery. There is a deficit of information between identified hits and the many criteria that must be fulfilled side by side to convert these hits into preclinical candidates that have a real chance to become a drug. This gap can be bridged by investigating and understanding the interactions between the ligands and their receptors. Accurate calculations of the free energy of binding are still elusive. Better knowledge of all these will help in finding good drug candidates to combat the diseases caused by animal viruses.|

However GAMG is quite rare in natural plants, and it must be prepared from glycyrrhizin (GL) by hydrolysing one terminal glucuronic acid. β-Glucuronidase is the key enzyme in the biotransformation of GL to GAMG, but its activities need to be enhanced to facilitate the industrial large-scale production of GAMG. In this study, we identified that isoliquiritigenin (ISL), as one of chemical compositions from the total flavonoids glycyrrhiza (TFG), can significantly enhance β-glucuronidase activity in vitro. Measurements using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the activity of β-glucuronidase could be increased by 2.66-fold via the addition of ISL to a β-glucuronidase solution that contained GL at a 3:10 molar ratio of ISL to GL. ISL was concluded to be an activator because ISL could reduce the K m and E a of β-glucuronidase reacting with GL. This study sheds new light on the mechanism of βglucuronidase and helps to make industrial production of GAMG through fermentation feasible.	Measurement of β-glucuronidase enzyme activity. In total, 400 μl of the β-glucuronidase enzyme was added to 200 μl of sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) that contained 2.4 mg/ml GL. After shaking in a water bath at 40 °C for 4 h, the enzyme was heat-inactivated. Then, 100 μl of the mixture was diluted to 1 ml with methanol, and the concentration of GAMG in the solution was measured by HPLC. One activity unit (U) of the β-glucuronidase enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme capable of releasing 1 μmol of GAMG per minute under the above conditions. HPLC analysis. The concentrations of GL and GAMG were measured with HPLC using an ODS column (Shim-pack, VP-ODS, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and a UV detector. The wavelength was set at 254 nm. A flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and an injection volume of 10 μl were used. The mobile phase was a mixture of 0.6% (v/v) acetic acid (pH 2.85) and methanol at a ratio of 19:81 (v/v). The retention times of GL and GAMG were approximately 7.5 and 15.9 min, respectively.|

During the process of apoptosis induced by TGEV infection in PK-15 cells, the miR-27b is notably down-regulated. Thus, we speculate that miR-27b is involved in regulating the process of apoptosis in PK-15 cells. In this study we demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-27b led to the inhibition of TGEV-induced apoptosis, reduction of Bax protein level, and decrease of caspase-3 and −9 activities. Conversely, silencing of miR-27b by miR-27b inhibitors enhanced apoptosis via up-regulating Bax expression and promoting the activities of caspase-3 and −9 in TGEV-infected cells. Subsequently, the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is a candidate target of miR-27b predicted by bioinformatics search. We further identified that the miR-27b directly bound to the 3 UTR of RUNX1 mRNA and suppressed RUNX1 expression, which indicates RUNX1 is the direct target gene of miR-27b. The over-expression of RUNX1 increased apoptosis and knockdown RUNX1blocked apoptosis of viral-infected cells via regulating Bax expression and the activities of caspase-3 and −9. Our data reveal that miR-27b may repress the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by targeting RUNX1, indicating that TGEV may induce apoptosis via down-regulating miR-27b and that miR-27b may act as a target for therapeutic intervention. Subjects Veterinary Medicine, Virology Keywords Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, miR-27b, Apoptosis, RUNX1 How to cite this article Zhao et al. (2016), miR-27b attenuates apoptosis induced by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection via targeting runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1).

However, development, production and quality control of antibodies is expensive and time consuming. To circumvent these difficulties, three peptides were derived from complementarity determining regions of an antibody heavy chain against influenza A spike glycoprotein. Their binding properties were studied experimentally, and by molecular dynamics simulations. Two peptide candidates showed binding to influenza A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2. One of them, termed PeB, with the highest affinity prevented binding to and infection of target cells in the micromolar region without any cytotoxic effect. PeB matches best the conserved receptor binding site of hemagglutinin. PeB bound also to other medical relevant influenza strains, such as human-pathogenic A/California/7/2009 H1N1, and avian-pathogenic A/Mute Swan/Rostock/R901/2006 H7N1. Strategies to improve the affinity and to adapt specificity are discussed and exemplified by a double amino acid substituted peptide, obtained by substitutional analysis. The peptides and their derivatives are of great potential for drug development as well as biosensing.	Finally, the workflow presented involving complementary experimental and theoretical approaches could be a template for the development of antiviral agents, which could be also applied for influenza detecting biochips. In a coevolutionary approach the peptide's primary sequence may also be adapted to seasonal upcoming mutations of the influenza virus with minor additional efforts, costs and in short time without the additional development of novel monoclonal antibodies.

A) Electrostatic, B) van der Waals and C) polar contributions to the total binding free energy change. The mutation of residue 6 (D6G) replacing a charged amino acid by a neutral one, decreases the electrostatic contribution, but such a change is largely overcome by an increase in the contribution to the solvation free energy change, as calculated. Mutation of amino acid 11 (Y11F) appears not to alter directly the contribution of the interaction between this residue and the HA, but it induces a favorable free energy change contribution in the interaction between residue 10 and the HA, essentially by a more favorable van der Waals interaction energy change between uncharged residues.

Numbers represent mean value of the contrast relative to contrast for positive control fetuin. False-colors are used to illuminate fluorescence intensities, color changes from blue (lower) to yellow (higher intensity than PeB). Data just represent qualitative relation between PeB mutants within single influenza strains. Quantitative comparison between different strains is not valid due to the varying types of samples, while precise quantitation fails due to unknown ligand density (most likely varying per peptide).

While L219 is identical for all subtypes, S159 and E215 are replaced in some cases by functional closely related T or D, respectively.

If bats in close interaction with humans host and shed coronaviruses with zoonotic potential, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus, spillover may occur. Therefore, strategies aiming to mitigate potential spillover and disease emergence, while supporting the conservation of bats and their important ecological roles are needed. Past research suggests that coronavirus shedding in bats varies seasonally following their reproductive cycle; however, shedding dynamics have been assessed in only a few species, which does not allow for generalization of findings across bat taxa and geographic regions.

Although the structure of HSV-1 has been extensively investigated, the precise organization of tegument and envelope proteins remains elusive. Here we use super-resolution imaging by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) in combination with a model-based analysis of single-molecule localization data, to determine the position of protein layers within virus particles. We resolve different protein layers within individual HSV-1 particles using multi-colour dSTORM imaging and discriminate envelopeanchored glycoproteins from tegument proteins, both in purified virions and in virions present in infected cells. Precise characterization of HSV-1 structure was achieved by particle averaging of purified viruses and model-based analysis of the radial distribution of the tegument proteins VP16, VP1/2 and pUL37, and envelope protein gD. From this data, we propose a model of the protein organization inside the tegument.

Following formula feeding and the proliferation of the intestinal flora, bacteria may attach to the damaged intestinal epithelia because of immaturity of the ''mucosal barrier,'' eliciting endogenous production of PAF and TNF. Although gut bacteria may themselves form PAF, the normal mucosal barrier probably prevents any deleterious action on the epithelium. However, in immature or mildly damaged mucosa, the close proximity of bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells may facilitate transcellular permeation of PAF into the mucosa. If the acetylhydrolase is deficient, PAF, which increases the intestinal epithelial permeability in vivo [80] ), may accumulate locally and further break down the mucosal barrier, resulting in local entry of bacteria or bacterial products. PAF may then synergize with LPS and/or TNF, reaching the necessary threshold to trigger a cascade of inflammatory events: PMN adhesion and activation, complement activation, and release of other inflammatory mediators as well as cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. The result could be the development of focal intestinal necrosis, which further promotes bacterial entry, thereby launching a selfperpetuating vicious cycle, leading to shock, sepsis and, sometimes, death. |

In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter. Moreover, the increased flexibility in the choice of the infection rate function makes it possible to better control the predictions due to the lockdown policy. 12 the outbreak containment. 13 We consider here deterministic compartmental models, based on a system of initial 14 value problems of Ordinary Differential Equations.

The SIR model and its 17 later modifications, such as Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) [4] were later 18 introduced in the study of outbreaks diffusion.

This study evaluated the association between the detection of multiple viruses by RT-PCR and disease severity in children with bronchiolitis. Methods: Children less than 2 years of age with clinical symptoms of bronchiolitis were prospectively included during three winter seasons. Patients were categorized in three groups based on disease severity; mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Multiplex RT-PCR of 15 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: In total, 142 samples were obtained. Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected virus (73%) followed by rhinovirus (RV) (30%). In 58 samples (41%) more than one virus was detected, of which 41% was a dual infection with RSV and RV. In RSV infected children younger than 3 months, disease severity was not associated with the number of detected viruses. Remarkably, in children older than 3 months we found an association between more severe disease and RSV mono-infections. Conclusion: Disease severity in children with bronchiolitis is not associated with infection by multiple viruses. We conclude that other factors, such as age, contribute to disease severity to a larger extent. Pediatr Pulmonol.	Our results suggest that other factors than infection with multiple viruses contributes to disease severity, of which age is the most important risk factor.|

IL-6 and IL-1b were not elevated compared to healthy donors. Gong, J. et al 11 Inflammation is closely related to severity of COVID-19, and IL-6, TNF and IL-8 might be promising therapeutic targets. IL-1b was below the detectable limit in all patients. Qin, C. et al 10 Within a large cohort, most of the severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. Wan, S. et al 9 Mild disease group had a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal, larger number of samples are needed to confirm. Zhou, F. et al 14 Elevated levels of blood IL-6 were more commonly seen in severe COVID-19 illness, other cytokines not measured. Liu J. et al 16 The degree of proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients, and is associated with disease severity. Chen, G. et al 5 Compared to moderate cases, severe cases had markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Ruan, Q. et al 15 Predictors of a fatal outcome in COVID-19 cases included age, the presence of underlying diseases, the presence of secondary infection and elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood. IL-6 was found to be 2 fold higher in deceased vs discharged patients (11.4 vs 6.8 pg/ml). Other cytokines not measured. Liu T et al 13 Compared with non-severe type (n-11), there was no difference in the level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and IFN-γ, while IL-10 increased slightly and IL-6 increased significantly (2.5 to 35 pg/ml, p=0.016) in patients with severe COVID-19 (n=69).|
526	05916d82efe1f937ee48f09df4e5d7c6fede83d3	Pattern formation in multiplex networks OPEN	The advances in understanding complex networks have generated increasing interest in dynamical processes occurring on them. Pattern formation in activator-inhibitor systems has been studied in networks, revealing differences from the classical continuous media. Here we study pattern formation in a new framework, namely multiplex networks. These are systems where activator and inhibitor species occupy separate nodes in different layers. Species react across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably, diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks. The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed by a combination of degrees in the different layers. Our theory demonstrates that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation.	Amplitude of non-uniform patterns. The amplitude of a non-uniform pattern is quantified as|

In spite of that, there are still massive challenges that have not been resolved. Although	The challenges outlined in this article are far from comprehensive, and specific unmet needs exist for a variety of other respiratory diseases, including alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary hypertension in the newborn, and others. While each disease state may have its own unique set of challenges, in general, one can categorize these into three major areas of need, namely, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention (Fig. 1 ). More specifically, these would include the identification of biomarkers to provide less invasive methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, as well as determining prognosis, the development of new drugs and treatment modalities, and also the development of vaccines or other environmental controls to reduce the incidence of the disease.|

Transpl Infect Dis 2012: 14: 548-550. All rights reserved	As reported by Jackson et al. (3), BOS is more than a single process, with acute BOS being defined as a sharp, steep, and irreversible decline in FEV 1 , triggered by an acute event, associated with episodes of acute allograft rejection in the first 6 months with a poor prognosis, while a more chronic form of the disorder has a smooth linear decline in pulmonary function and is less likely to be associated with acute events with a better prognosis. This case further illustrates that different phenotypes of BOS do exist, and the fact that acute or chronic phenotypes can occur at any time after lung transplantation. The aggressiveness of this disorder was even more impressive in the patient presented herein, as compared with the cases reported in the prospective study by Hopkins et al. (7) . Additional research is needed to identify the pathogenesis of RSV infection in relation to the development of BOS in lung transplant recipients, to help identify therapeutic targets to optimize outcomes in lung transplantation.|

The initial evaluation of its effectiveness in its first 3 years suggests that it has been effective in reducing TB-associated incidence and mortality. Sustained monitoring of the effectiveness of the NTP is necessary. Furthermore, in cities and counties that have seen an increase in TB, local health authorities and the CDC need to focus their efforts on controlling TB and investigating the reasons for its increase, with special attention paid to rigorous surveillance of rate fluctuations, especially regarding TB incidence.|

Despite the importance of cattle farming in Austria, little is known in this country about the abundance and distribution of bovine Eimeria spp. The objective of this study was to obtain detailed information about the occurrence of different Eimeria spp. on Austrian dairy farms. Fecal samples from individual calves (n0868) from 296 farms all over Austria (82 districts) were collected. Additionally, each farmer was questioned about the occurrence of calf diarrhea, and about the knowledge on coccidiosis and possible control measures. On 97.97% of the investigated farms, calves excreted Eimeria oocysts, and 83.67% of the individual samples were positive. After sporulation of positive samples pooled from each farm, 11 Eimeria species were found, with E. bovis (in 65.54% of the samples and 27.74% of the farms), E.zuernii (63.85%/13.86%), E. auburnensis (56.76%/13.41%) and E. ellipsoidalis (54.05%/14.38%) being the most prevalent, followed by E. alabamensis (45.61%/11.56%), E. subspherica (35.14%/5.5.05%), E. cylindrica (33.11%/7.00%), and E. canadensis (31.08%/7.74%). E. wyomingensis, E. pellita and E. bukidnonensis were only found sporadically (3.04-4.73% of the samples and 0.16-0.59% of the farms). Mixed infections were present on all farms (2-9 Eimeria species/ farm). Prevalences by state provinces were high throughout with 77.1-87.9% of the samples and 93.8-100% of the farms. Lower Austria had the highest percentage of positive farms, and Vorarlberg the lowest. Individual OPG (oocysts per gram of feces) values were generally low; 75% of the samples had an OPG of 1,000 or less. The highest detected OPG was 72,400. The mean OPG was 2,525 with above average numbers in Tirol, Carinthia, and Lower Austria. The mean OPG values were significantly positively correlated with the cattle density in the different districts. The majority of the samples were from female Simmenthal calves. Clinical coccidiosis (diarrhea) was observed in 74 cases, and (semi-)liquid diarrhea (56 animals) was significantly correlated with OPG (p<0.05). Linear regression on the OPG data showed that OPG values significantly decreased with increasing age of the calves, while the percentage of positive samples increased with age (p<0.05 for both). The term ""coccidia"" was familiar to 45% of the farmers, and anticoccidial treatment was performed by 13.51% of them, most commonly with toltrazuril. Considering the ubiquitous occurrence and the possible clinical and economic relevance of calf eimeriosis, infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians."	In conclusion, it could be shown that Eimeria spp., especially the pathogenic species E. bovis and E. zuernii, are prevalent in Austrian dairy herds, causing mostly subclinical infections. Taking into consideration the economic importance of bovine coccidiosis and the possibility of severe outbreaks especially on larger farms and in areas with higher cattle density, surveying and controlling the infection should receive an increased awareness.|

Sulfite 4 worked as a practical monomer for the preparation of (1 ? 2)-linked polysaccharide skeletons. The chemical stability of 4 was evaluated by the comparison of thermodynamic parameters with those of conventional epoxide (2). The grafting reaction of 4 from glycyrrhetic acid (5) was performed in the presence of TfOH and MS 3A in CH 2 Cl 2 at room temperature. The polymerization degree was moderately controllable by the change of feed ratio of initiator.	In conclusion, we demonstrated a new grafting reaction of cyclic sulfite 4 from glycyrrhetic acid 5 to give glycyrrhetic acid polyglycosides in one-pot via cationic ring-opening condensation polymerization of 4. The method enables the rapid preparation of glycyrrhizin derivatives consisting oligosaccharides with arbitrary polymerization degree. Because other natural glycosides bearing (1 ? 2)-linked oligosaccharides such as cyaniding-3-Osophoroside 19 and quercetin-3-O-sophoroside 20 have been reported, this method would be also applicable to the preparations of their derivatives. The present results may provide new insights into not only natural product syntheses but also the creation of high performance polymers based on a grafting reaction. Further investigations on the control of stereochemistry on the anomeric centers and the evaluation of structure-activity relationship are currently in progress. |

An overview	The 2014-2015 outbreak of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa has been considered a major global health emergency by the WHO. Implications for health care providers including oral and maxillo-facial surgeons have been published by the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA), and other medical societies and public health organizations. While the risk of infection with the Ebola virus seems to be rather small in Europe, maxillo-facial and plastic surgeons often travel to Africa to treat patients with facial burns, cleft-lip and palate, and noma. The likelihood of an encounter with patients infected by Ebola virus in subsaharan and West Africa, therefore, has increased during the last 2 years. The purpose of this short overview was to summarize the virology of the Ebola virus, transmission, epidemiology, clinical features, oral manifestations, treatment, and possible implications for maxillo-facial surgeons of EDV.	Until this date, no infection with Ebola virus of dental personnel has been reported from Europe. As Samaranayake et al. [14] and Galvin et al. [5] have clearly stated the dental team is very unlikely to encounter a new presentation of the Ebola virus infection in Europe. However, whenever health care providers including oral and maxillofacial surgeons give treatment to patients in West or subsaharan Africa an encounter with Ebola has become a reality. Particularly, asymptomatic patients with Ebola virus disease or those with early stage nonspecific symptoms may present for dental or surgical treatment. For individuals who may have had contact with Ebola virus, infected patients postponement of non-essential treatment is required for 21 days after possible exposure. This is presently the period of quarantine recommended [15] .|

Oral rimantadine treatment did not reduce the otologic manifestations of experimental influenza in adults or natural influenza in children. However, intranasal zanamivir and oral oseltamivir significantly reduced MEP abnormalities during experimental influenza in adults, and oseltamivir treatment appears to reduce the likelihood of otitis media in children with acute influenza. Investigational anti-HRV agents, including intranasal tremacamra, intranasal AG7088, and oral pleconaril, warrant study in this regard. Depending on the virus, early antiviral therapy has the potential to impact the risk of otitis media following respiratory tract infections.	When used for prophylaxis for experimental influenza A(H1N1) virus infection, oral oseltamivir once or twice daily was also highly protective against virus recovery from the upper respiratory tract and virus associated in infection-related illness [20] . Early oseltamivir treatment beginning at 28 h after viral inoculation was also associated with significant antiviral effects, reduced symptom scores, and lower nasal proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-g). This was associated with halving of nasal mucus weights and symptom scores and 2-day reductions in the duration of viral shedding and time to alleviation of illness. The frequency of upper respiratory tract illness was reduced, and significant MEP abnormalities were seen in 54% of placebo recipients compared to 28% of those receiving oseltamivir. Such results further substantiate a link between virus replication, cytokine elaboration and symptom production during acute influenza. These findings also indicate that early inhibition of viral replication down regulates this series of responses and reduces the likelihood of significant ET dysfunction leading to abnormal MEP. However, the signs and symptoms in such experimental infections are relatively mild compared to naturally occurring influenza in patients presenting for medical care and the timing of antiviral intervention earlier. Despite these caveats, preliminary analysis of results from a study of children aged 1 -12 years with acute influenza has found that oseltamivir treatment provided symptom benefit and reduced the likelihood of AOM development [21] . These findings indicate that early antiviral intervention can reduce the risk of middle ear disease during influenza in children.|

In this paper, we propose NLPExplorer, a completely automatic portal for indexing, searching, and visualizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) research volume. NLPExplorer presents interesting insights from papers, authors, venues, and topics. In contrast to previous topic modelling based approaches, we manually curate five course-grained non-exclusive topical categories namely Linguistic Target (Syntax, Discourse, etc.), Tasks (Tagging, Summarization, etc.), Approaches (unsupervised, supervised, etc.), Languages (English, Chinese, etc.) and Dataset types (news, clinical notes, etc.). Some of the novel features include a list of young popular authors, popular URLs and datasets, list of topically diverse papers and recent popular papers. Also, it provides temporal statistics such as yearwise popularity of topics, datasets, and seminal papers. To facilitate future research and system development, we make all the processed dataset accessible through API calls. The current system is available at http://nlpexplorer.org.	In this paper, we present an end-to-end automated system that periodically mines the ACL Anthology and serves as a tool to aid researchers in knowledge exploration and discovery. The goal of NLPExplorer is to serve as a retrieval engine for research papers, as well as a tool to assist researchers in knowledge discovery by helping them to better understand the problem domain, the top researchers in the field of study, and the latest research in the domain. Even though, the current system supports NLP research domain, we claim that similar systems can be built for any domain given the availability of full text articles and basic metadata.|

Infected patients come down with acute fever and rashes, and a portion of them suffer from both acute and chronic arthralgia. Currently, there are no targeted therapeutics against this debilitating virus. One approach to develop potential therapeutics is by understanding the viral-host interactions. However, to date, there has been limited research undertaken in this area. In this review, we attempt to briefly describe and update the functions of the different CHIKV proteins and their respective interacting host partners. In addition, we also survey the literature for other reported host factors and pathways involved during CHIKV infection. There is a pressing need for an in-depth understanding of the interaction between the host environment and CHIKV in order to generate potential therapeutics.

Our current understanding of virulence evolution is based on insights drawn from two perspectives that have developed largely independently: long-standing evolutionary theory based on limited real data examples that often lack a genomic basis, and experimental studies of virulence-determining mutations using cell culture or animal models. A more comprehensive understanding of virulence mutations and their evolution can be achieved by bridging the gap between these two research pathways through the phylogenomic analysis of virus genome sequence data as a guide to experimental study.	Finally, it is possible that an increased understanding of virulence evolution drawn from a phylogenomic approach may contribute to new strategies for pathogen control and eradication, and there is a clear potential for this framework to inform and improve the fields of disease management and the biological control of invasive pests. Although predicting where and when a new disease might emerge is clearly unfeasible because of the immense complexities involved 54, 130 , predicting the overall trajectory of the virulence evolution of a virus in a novel host may be more achievable. Once again, biocontrol presents a compelling example. Although controversial [131] [132] [133] , the proposed release of cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) as a biological control against invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) in Australia may present a unique opportunity to follow, in real time, the co-evolution between host and virus at both the genotypic and phenotypic scales. Both theory and virus natural history predict that CyHV-3 virulence will decline with time 134 , and it will be interesting and informative to see how any such virulence evolution is manifest in phylogenomic data.|

In a rapid response published online by the British Medical Journal, Sommerstein and Gräni 1 pushed forward the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-Is) could act as a potential risk factor for fatal Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by up-regulating ACE2. This notion was quickly picked up by the lay press and sparked concerns among physicians and patients regarding the intake of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infected individuals. 1 In this article, we try to shed light on what is known and unknown regarding the RAAS and SARS-CoV2 interaction. We find translational evidence for diverse roles of the RAAS, which allows to formulate also the opposite hypothesis, i.e. that inhibition of the RAAS might be protective in COVID-19.

The disease spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreaks starts on 2 nd March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We consider the initial phase of the outbreak situation in India and our proposed model is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported cases during the period 2 nd March, 2020 to 24 th March, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect of preventive measures such as spread of awareness, lock-down, proper hand sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Two intervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the period of implementation. Our study suggests that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the strength of the intervention should be strengthened over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.	We studied the impact of intervention in reducing the disease burden. We basically considered the preventive measures such as lock-down, spreading of awareness program through media, proper hand sanitization, etc. which slow down the disease transmissibility. Two intervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the period of implementation. In the first scenario, we fixed the strength of the intervention throughout the period of implementation and studied the impact of intervention for different level of intervention efforts. In this scenario, our study reveals that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time. In the second scenario, the whole implementation time are divided into three time windows and in each of the window, the intervention strength is taken to be different. In such a scenario, our analysis shows that the strength of the intervention should not be relaxed over the time rather the intervention should be strengthened to eradicate the disease effectively. Designing the efficient intervention strategy is one of the crucial factor to curb the disease spread in an outbreak situation. In this regard, our study suggests that strict intervention should be implemented by the Government in the subsequent period of this outbreak. We believe that the findings obtained from this study can provide fruitful insights in framing policies regarding the control of COVID-19 in India.|

In plants, this includes RNA silencing. To uncover additional bottlenecks to RNA virus infection, we genetically attenuated the impact of RNA silencing on transgenically expressed Potato virus X (PVX), a (+)strand RNA virus that replicates in Arabidopsis. A genetic screen in this sensitized background uncovered how nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), a host RNA quality control mechanism, recognizes and eliminates PVX RNAs with internal termination codons and long 3 0 UTRs. NMD also operates in natural infection contexts, and while some viruses have evolved genome expression strategies to overcome this process altogether, the virulence of NMD-activating viruses entails their ability to directly suppress NMD or to promote an NMD-unfavorable cellular state. These principles of induction, evasion, and suppression define NMD as a general viral restriction mechanism in plants that also likely operates in animals.

We urgently need a new craft of home maintenance, one that sees the human species' role as ecosystem engineer for what it has becomethe global agent of change. Despite uncertainty, we need to act to prevent environmental harm and to reconnect human with natural economies. By using indicators that measure what matters for sustaining living systems, we can make nature visible again and shed new light on the value of the ancient heritage we share with the larger biosphere. We can reunite the fragments of our worldview and re-create ethical, social, and ecological bonds that were put aside two centuries ago in the name of progress. And we can reengineer our own social, political, and economic institutions instead of ecosystems. This we must donowbefore we impoverish the biosphere and risk our own survival for all time.|

In the USA alone, nosocomial infections cause about 1.7 million infections and 99 000 deaths per year. HAIs are spread by numerous routes including surfaces (especially hands), air, water, intravenous routes, oral routes and through surgery. Interventions such as proper hand and surface cleaning, better nutrition, sufficient numbers of nurses, better ventilator management, use of coated urinary and central venous catheters and use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have all been associated with significantly lower nosocomial infection rates. Multiple infection control techniques and strategies simultaneously ('bundling') may offer the best opportunity to reduce the morbidity and mortality toll of HAIs. Most of these infection control strategies will more than pay for themselves by saving the medical costs associated with nosocomial infections. Many non-pharmacological interventions to prevent many HAIs will also reduce the need for long or multiple-drug antibiotic courses for patients. Lower antibiotic drug usage will reduce risk of antibiotic-resistant organisms and should improve efficacy of antibiotics given to patients who do acquire infections.	Multiple-intervention infection control strategies should significantly reduce mortality, morbidity and overall medical costs. There needs to be more support for improved hospital infection control on the part of patient advocacy groups, nursing, medical and public health associations, hospital administrators, health insurance companies, business and labour groups, the media and public officials. Research and implementation of multifaceted hospital infection control strategies should clearly be one of the highest priority items facing healthcare in the early 21st century. |

They involve auxiliary variables, such that their energy minimisation splits into multiple fractional steps that can be solved easier and more efficiently. In our paper we show that coupling models offer a number of interesting properties that go far beyond their obvious numerical benefits. We demonstrate that discontinuity-preserving denoising can be achieved even with quadratic data and smoothness terms, provided that the coupling term involves the L 1 norm. We show that such an L 1 coupling term provides additional information as a powerful edge detector that has remained unexplored so far. While coupling models in the literature approximate higher order regularisation, we argue that already first order coupling models can be useful. As a specific example, we present a first order coupling model that outperforms classical TV regularisation. It also establishes a theoretical connection between TV regularisation and the Mumford-Shah segmentation approach. Unlike other Mumford-Shah algorithms, it is a strictly convex approximation, for which we can guarantee convergence of a split Bregman algorithm.	We have shown that coupling terms in variational models are useful for more than just easing numerics. Already first order models that contain a coupling term in the sparsity promoting L 1 norm are sufficient for edge-preserving denoising. For the remaining data and smoothness terms we can use simple quadratic L 2 norms. This does not only simplify the numerical minimisation scheme, it also challenges the common belief that edge-preserving denoising requires a nonquadratic smoothness term. The first order coupling model also shows a theoretical connection to the classical segmentation model of Mumford and Shah. As it works on a strictly convex energy, we obtain an approximation of the Mumford-Shah functional that has a unique solution and is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, the introduced coupling term itself carries valuable information: It has the properties of a global edge detector that is robust against noise and comes at literally no cost as a byproduct of the minimisation. In our ongoing research we investigate how the coupling formulation can be extended to applications in deblurring or inpainting or in combination with anisotropic regularisation. Moreover, we intend to exploit the simplicity of the quadratic terms by using parallel implementations to gain more efficient solvers.|

To ensure that life-saving health services are able to continue, the Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Pandemic (OHPIP) provides direction for assessing and treating patients with influenza, remotely and through the implementation of alternate assessment, treatment and referral centres (Flu Centres). The OHPIP also provides tools and resources for local pandemic planners to assist them with the implementation of this strategy.	The Ontario Health Plan for an Influenza Pandemic is an evergreen plan that continues to be updated and enhanced in collaboration with key health stakeholders and emergency management professionals based on emerging scientific evidence and input from stakeholders.

We performed an internet-based, region-stratified survey among 352 HCWs and 189 individuals in the general population enrolled on March 17 th and 18 th 2020 from 26 Chinese provinces. The HCWs developed a more in-depth understanding of SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection and showed a higher tolerance to the future vaccination than the general population. 76.4% of HCWs (vs. 72.5% in the general) showed their willingness to receive vaccination. Potential benefits from COVID-19 outbreak such as seeking influenza (65.3%) or pneumonia (55.7%) vaccination can be gained in HCWs. To estimate the relative effects of attributes influencing vaccination choice in the discrete choice experiment, 7 attributes (3 disease-relevant, 3 vaccine-relevant, and 1 of social acceptance) were identified as key determinants. Among them, disease trend (odds ratio, OR: 4.367 (95%CI, 3.721-5.126) for seasonal epidemic, OR: 3.069 (2.612-3.605) for persistent epidemic, with reference to disappearance in summer), social contacts' decisions (0.398: 0.339-0.467 for refusal, 0.414: 0.353-0.487 for neutral, with reference to acceptance) and high possibility of being infected (2.076: 1.776-2.425 for infection probability of 30%+ ) were significantly associated with increased probability of choosing vaccination in the HCWs. In contrast, for the general population, vaccine safety and social contacts' decisions were the most important predictors. For COVID-19	(which was not peer-reviewed) The Prob > chi2 ***|

Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.

In all urological departments, quickly inpatient and outpatient services have been significantly reduced. Even in this COVID-19 situation, urological neoplasm care must go on, but significant changes need to be made in the way some care is delivered. We compared diagnostic and therapeutic elective procedures requested and performed for PC management from our multidisciplinary team (MDT) during 1 month activity in the highest national level of COVID-19 infection (March 2020) and under restrictions for all the population, with the management performed in a no-COVID-19 month (March 2019) 1 year ago. The only management that did not received a significant reduction are medical therapies for advanced hormone sensitive (HS) or castration resistant (CR) PC. We describe our MDT identifications of elective undeferrable PC management in this COVID-19 time. These suggestions have been considered for a country (ITALY) under a rapid increase of COVID-19 cases and complications, but in a region with an actual lower impact (2914 actual positive and 1079 hospitalized cases) from the infection and in an hospital not completely converted to COVID-19 management.

Host cells produce cytokines and chemokines in response to viral infection, and among such effector molecules, type I interferons are the principal antiviral cytokines and therefore effective targets for viruses to disarm host surveillance. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) expresses proteins that circumvent the IFN response and other cellular processes, and to compensate the small coding capacity of PRRSV, these proteins are multifunctional. To date, at least four viral proteins have been identified and studied as viral antagonists of host defenses: N as a structural protein and three non-structural proteins, Nsp1 (Nsp1␣ and Nsp1␤), Nsp2, and Nsp11. Among these, N and Nsp1 are nuclear-cytoplasmic proteins distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. Nsp1 and Nsp2 are viral proteases while Nsp11 is an endoribonuclease. This review describes the current understanding of the role of these proteins in modulating the host innate immune responses. Blocking against virus-mediated inhibition of the innate response may lead to the future development of effective vaccines. The understanding of viral mechanisms modulating the normal cellular processes will be a key to the design of an effective control strategy for PRRS.	The PRRSV genome is duplicated into dsRNA during replication, which can trigger a cascade of cellular events, and PRRSV has evolved to subvert host IFN surveillance for effective survival. To date, at least four viral proteins involved in the modulation of innate immunity have been studied: N as a structural protein and three non-structural proteins, Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp11. Among these, N and Nsp1 are nuclear-cytoplasmic proteins distributed in the both nucleus and cytoplasm of cell. The N protein in the nucleolus appears to participate in the cell cycle progression as well as immune modulation, whereas Nsp1 inhibits IFN production by degrading CREB-binding protein in the nucleus. Specifically, the Nsp1␣ subunit of Nsp1 blocks phosphorylation of IB and thus prevents IB degradation to retain NF-B in the cytoplasm in the silent form. It is probable that CBP degradation is mediated by Nsp1␣ in the nucleus while NF-B activation is blocked by the cytoplasmic form of Nsp1␣. While the N protein nuclear localization is NLS-dependent, the basis for Nsp1␣ nuclear transport is unknown, and the structural differences between the nuclear and cytoplasm forms of Nsp1␣ are also unknown. It is intriguing that PIAS protein appears to interact with both N protein and Nsp1␣ subunit, and their biological consequences need to be further studied. Both N and Nsp1␣ may be sumoylated by PIAS1 to function in cellular processes, or binding of N and Nsp1␣ to PIAS1 may alter the normal PIAS function to gain benefits for favorable replication of the virus. Nsp2 is a cysteine protease, and deconjugation of ubiquitin and ISG15 by Nsp2 from key signaling molecules is an emerging mechanism of immune evasion by PRRSV to silence the inflammatory and IFN responses. Nsp4 is a serine protease whereas Nsp11 is an endoribonuclease, and both Nsp's have also been suggested to participate in the immune evasion strategy of PRRSV. Blocking against PRRSV-induced inhibition of the innate immune response may lead to the future development of effective vaccines or the discovery of novel antiviral compounds. The understanding of viral mechanisms modulating the normal cellular processes during infection will be a key to developing an effective future control strategy for PRRS.|

However, the main viral proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro) has recently been regarded as a suitable target for drug design against SARS infection due to its vital role in polyproteins processing necessary for coronavirus reproduction. The present in silico study was designed to evaluate the effect of Jensenone, a essential oil component from eucalyptus oil, on Mpro by docking study. In the present study, molecular docking studies were conducted by using 1-click dock and swiss dock tools. Protein interaction mode was calculated by Protein Interactions Calculator.The calculated parameters such as binding energy, and binding site similarity indicated effective binding of Jensenone to COVID-19 proteinase. Active site prediction further validated the role of active site residues in ligand binding. PIC results indicated that, Mpro/ Jensenone complexes forms hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond interactions and strong ionic interactions. Therefore, Jensenone may represent potential treatment potential to act as COVID-19 Mpro inhibitor. However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential medicinal use.	Currently, the main target for COVID-19 treatment primarily act on the main protease (Mpro). The aim of this study was to examine Jensenone from eucalyptus essential oil that may be used to inhibit the COVID-19 infection pathway. Jensenone has high binding affinity and lowest binding energies. Therefore, we suggested that may Jensenone may represent potential treatment options, and found in medicinal plants that may act as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 Mpro. However, further studies should be conducted for the validation of these compounds using in vitro and in vivo models to pave a way for these compounds in drug discovery.|

As proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the development and maintenance of local inflammation, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of OMZ on immune cells in order to diminish the mucosal infiltration of the nose. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from buffy coats of healthy volunteers were isolated and stimulated in the presence or absence of OMZ. In addition, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC) were generated and different concentrations of OMZ were added. DC phenotype and their T-cell stimulatory properties were analysed.The vasoactive substance OMZ showed a concentration dependent inhibitory effect on T-cell activation as well as a dominant effect on T-cell stimulatory properties of DC. Low concentrations of OMZ inhibited the proliferation of polyclonally activated T cells.	In conclusion, we demonstrate that OMZ significantly reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines by activated mononuclear cells of the peripheral blood. This results in a decreased proliferation capacity of T cells. In addition, OMZ is able to inhibit the immunostimulatory capacity of human DC without influencing their phenotype. These findings may explain the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of OMZ in acute viral rhinitis seen in vivo.|

In this current manuscript used red blood cell hitchhiking loaded/absorbed with nanocarrier for targeted delivery to the lung and the brain. I think that this paper does show a degree of novelty based on the prior concept of nanocarrier targeting with the addition of the particles to red blood cells. The authors do a good job of convincing me that this approach can be translatable, and their validation of the effect of NC uptake across multiple species provides good evidence of the efficacy of future use. The delivery of these NC particles is explored well, and the mechanism of delivery in the lungs is elucidated and well explained. Having said that, I have the following issues regarding this manuscript.	"Page 14: Remove ""as"" in the second paragraph. Also, remove second comma, 4th paragraph. Supplemental Figure 2 .

Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are increasingly coming to realize that parasites and pathogens, like free-living organisms, evolve as the consequence of these anthropogenic changes. Although this area now commands the attention of a variety of researchers, a broad predictive framework is lacking, mainly because the links between human activities, the environment and parasite evolution are complex. From empirical and theoretical examples chosen in the literature, we give an overview of the ways in which humans can directly or indirectly influence the evolution of different traits in parasites ( e.g. specificity, virulence, polymorphism). We discuss the role of direct and indirect factors as diverse as habitat fragmentation, pollution, biodiversity loss, climate change, introduction of species, use of vaccines and antibiotics, ageing of the population, etc. We also present challenging questions for further research. Understanding the links between anthropogenic changes and parasite evolution needs to become a cornerstone of public health planning, economic development and conservation biology.	But perhaps the greatest challenge towards the construction of a predictive framework of pathogen evolution will be the integration of multiple species interactions within one set of models. A limitation of the current 'virulence management' models is their focus on one-host/oneparasite systems (but see Gandon 2004; Restif & Grenfell 2006; for exceptions) . In reality, any given host-parasite interaction is just one of many interconnected interactions within a complex network of host and parasite species. Although simple one-host/one-parasite systems are more easily tractable mathematically, ignoring the broader community context probably means that we are overlooking several important evolutionary phenomena. As we aim to anticipate and control any change in diseases resulting from man-made ecosystem changes, we will need to take this complexity into account.|

However, the influenza surveillance program shows that other viruses, especially rhinoviruses, are often associated with symptoms of cough, fever, and fatigue. We found relatively low levels of coronaviruses in both years, in contrast to previous reports. This study contributes to the demonstration of the importance of PCR in the investigation of the epidemiology and laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viral infections. PCR assays provide an opportunity to identify new viruses and detect those which do not replicate reliably in cultured cells.

Moreover, infection is often caused by a combination of viruses acting at the same time. The present study demonstrates, using multiplex RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR, that in the 2015/2016 influenza season, co-infections were confirmed in patients aged 1 month to 90 years. We found 73 co-infections involving influenza viruses, 17 involving influenza viruses and influenza-like viruses, and six involving influenza-like viruses. The first type of co-infections above mentioned was the most common, amounting to 51 cases, with type A and B viruses occurring simultaneously. There also were four cases of co-infections with influenza virus A/H1N1/pdm09 and A/H1N1/ subtypes and two cases with A/H1N1/pdm09 and A/H3N2/ subtypes. The 2015/ 2016 epidemic season was characterized by a higher number of confirmed co-infections compared with the previous seasons. Infections by more than one respiratory virus were most often found in children and in individuals aged over 65.	In the 2015/2016 epidemic season, there was a higher number of confirmed co-infections with influenza and respiratory influenza-like viruses, compared with previous seasons. In the 2012/ 2013 season, co-infections were as follows: ten of subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 with A/H3N2/ and 8 of A/H3N2/ with type B virus (Czarkowski et al. 2014) . In the 2013/2014 season, co-infections were as follows: two of subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 with A/H3N2/, seven of influenza with influenza-like viruses (two of influenza type A virus, RSV A virus, and RV A/B virus in one-day old and one-month-old children each), and three of influenza-like viruses (Bednarska et al. 2015) . In the 2014/2015 season, in a framework of the I-MOVE (Influenza Monitoring of Vaccine Effectiveness) program, the following co-infections were detected: seven of subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 with type B virus and eight of subtype A/H3N2/ with type B virus. In that last season, in addition, one co-infection of influenza viruses and four of influenza viruses with influenza-like viruses were noted in children under 14 years of age . A significant increase in the number of infections with more than one respiratory virus in the 2015/2016 season could be associated with a higher number of samples tested (8542 samples) compared with the two preceding seasons (2479 and 2416 samples, respectively) Bednarska et al. 2015) . Nonetheless, influenza viruses constantly evolve, undergoing antigenic changes, which provides them the ability to elude the host immune response system (Webster et al. 2013 ).|

Neither lineage was associated with a different spectrum of symptoms or age prevalence. There was a cyclical nature to the appearance of the various hMPV lineages. In 2004 only B1 and B2 sublineages were detected while from early 2005 lineage A became more prevalent. In Cape Town the hMPV lineages circulating in young children have been monitored over a 5-year period. In 2001 only A1 was detected; in 2002 and 2003 A1 and B2 were found; 2004 the predominant sublineage was B1 and to a lesser extent B2 while in 2005 sublineage A1, A2, A3, and B1 were detected [Smuts et al., 2004 and unpublished data] . A study undertaken in Johannesburg, South Africa from 2000 to 2002 showed similar but slightly different circulation patterns [Ludewick et al., 2005] . This complex pattern of co-circulation may be related to pre-existing immunity in the general population to one or more sublineages allowing the emergence of a different sublineage with a changed antigenic profile. These changes in the dominant virus lineage have also been reported in respiratory viruses like RSV [Peret et al., 2000; Venter et al., 2001] . The identification of a novel sublineage of lineage A in this study, has also been observed by Huck et al. [2006] who reported an increased divergence of lineage A. HBoV is a highly conserved virus and thus sequence analysis of the more variable capsid gene allowed for the phylogenetic differentiation of strains. In this study all HBoV isolates were closely related to st2.|

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV.	is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263 doi: medRxiv preprint |

Chronic social stress is thought to generate a proinflammatory state characterized by elevated antibacterial defenses and reduced investment in antiviral defense. Here, we manipulated long-term social status in female rhesus macaques to show that social subordination alters the gene expression response to ex vivo bacterial and viral challenge. As predicted by current models, bacterial lipopolysaccharide polarizes the immune response such that low status corresponds to higher expression of genes in NF-κBdependent pro-inflammatory pathways and lower expression of genes involved in the antiviral response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Counter to predictions, however, low status drives more exaggerated expression of both NF-κB and IFN-associated genes after cells are exposed to the viral mimic Gardiquimod. Status-driven gene expression patterns are not only linked to social status at the time of sampling, but also to social history (i.e., past social status), especially in unstimulated cells. However, for a subset of genes, we observed interaction effects in which females who fell in rank were more strongly affected by current social status than those who climbed the social hierarchy. Together, our results indicate that the effects of social status on immune cell gene expression depend on pathogen exposure, pathogen type, and social history -in support of social experience-mediated biological embedding in adulthood, even in the conventionally memory-less innate immune system.

Specific management includes antiviral treatment with oseltamivir (for influenza viruses) and the avoidance of corticosteroids which seem to be deleterious. In ICU patients, ARDS may be due to (or aggravated by) HSV bronchopneumonitis or CMV pneumonia. Both pathogens are reactivated in response to immunoparalysis after several days of ICU stay. HSV or CMV recovery from the lower respiratory tract does not necessarily mean viral disease, but their identification should lead to the search for true parenchymal involvement, either by cytology or virus-load determination. Specific management includes acyclovir for patients with ARDS and HSV bronchopneumonitis. The use of ganciclovir in patients with CMV pneumonia should be discussed patient by patient. Ventilatory management of patients with virus-induced ARDS is the same as that for ARDS of other etiologies. Notably, the H1N1-2009 pandemic renewed interest in a potentially lifesaving interesting salvage therapy, ECMO [27] . Further studies are needed to confirm its contribution to ARDS management.

In March 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting to identify policies and activities to promote access to vaccination of older adults, specifically in LMICs. Participants included academic and industry researchers, funders, civil society organizations, implementers of global health interventions, and stakeholders from developing countries with adult immunization needs. These experts reviewed vaccine performance in older adults, the anticipated impact of adult vaccination programs, and the challenges and opportunities of building or strengthening an adult and older adult immunization platforms. Key conclusions of the meeting were that there is a need for discussion of new opportunities for vaccination of all adults as well as for vaccination of older adults, as reflected in the recent shift by WHO to a life-course approach to immunization; that immunization in adults should be viewed in the context of a much broader model based on an individual's abilities rather than chronological age; and that immunization beyond infancy is a global priority that can be successfully integrated with other interventions to promote healthy ageing. As WHO is looking ahead to a global Decade of Healthy Ageing starting in 2020, it will seek to define a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate immunization with improving access to preventive and other healthcare interventions for adults worldwide.

Oct4 of maternal origin is postulated to play critical role in defining totipotency and inducing pluripotency during embryonic development. However, the genetic elimination of maternal Oct4 using a Cre-lox approach in mouse revealed that the establishment of totipotency in maternal Oct4-depleted embryos was not affected, and that these embryos could complete full-term development without any obvious defect. These results indicate that Oct4 is not essential for the initiation of pluripotency, in contrast to its critical role in maintaining pluripotency. This conclusion is further supported by the formation of Oct4-GFP-and Nanog-expressing inner cell masses (ICMs) in embryos with complete inactivation of both maternal and zygotic Oct4 expression and the reprogramming of fibroblasts into fully pluripotent cells by Oct4-deficient oocytes.

581	0ec759a568cb64acd211d0977da4ee9b098a7dec	Structural Characterization of the Glycoprotein GP2 Core Domain from the CAS Virus, a Novel Arenavirus-Like Species Correspondence to	"Fusion of the viral and host cell membranes is a necessary first step for infection by enveloped viruses and is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein. The transmembrane subunits from the structurally defined ""class I"" glycoproteins adopt an α-helical ""trimer-of-hairpins"" conformation during the fusion pathway. Here, we present our studies on the envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit, GP2, of the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently identified from annulated tree boas (Corallus annulatus) with inclusion body disease and is implicated in the disease etiology. We have generated and characterized two protein constructs consisting of the predicted CASV GP2 core domain. The crystal structure of the CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation indicates a trimeric α-helical bundle that is highly similar to those of Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2 despite CASV genome homology to arenaviruses. Denaturation studies demonstrate that the stability of CASV GP2 is pH dependent with higher stability at lower pH; we propose that this behavior is due to a network of interactions among acidic residues that would destabilize the α-helical bundle under conditions where the side chains are deprotonated. The pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion structure has been observed in Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2, as well as other viruses that enter via the endosome. Infection experiments with CASV and the related Golden Gate virus support a mechanism of entry that requires endosomal acidification. Our results suggest that, despite being primarily arenavirus like, the transmembrane subunit of CASV is extremely similar to the filoviruses."

584	1e302274f255ae85eb87c195ea7c3dfbbdb08c9e		The SIR evolutionary model predicts too sharp a decrease of the fractions of people infected with COVID-19 in France after the start of the national lockdown, compared to what is observed. I introduce three extensions to these models to fit the daily arrivals in French hospitals, as well in critical care, releases and deaths. These models involve ratios of evolutionary timescales to branching fractions, assumed uniform throughout a country, and the basic reproduction number, R 0 , before and during the national lockdown, for each region of France. The hospital data are well fit by the models with the exception of the arrivals in critical care, which are found to decrease in time faster than predicted by all models. This suggests that hospitals have learnt over time to better treat COVID-19 patients without resorting to critical care. The basic reproductive factor, averaged over France, was R 0 = 3.4 ± 0.1 before the lockdown and 0.65 ± 0.04 (90% c.l.) during the lockdown, both with small regional variations. On 11 May 2020, the Infection Fatality Rate in France is 4 ± 1% (90% c.l.) and constant, while the Feverish vastly outnumber the Asymptomatic, contrary to the early phases. Without the lockdown nor social distancing, over 2 million deaths from COVID-19 would have occurred throughout France. The fraction of immunized people reached a plateau below 1% throughout France (3% in Paris) by late April 2020 (95% c.l.), suggesting a lack of herd immunity and that a second wave of the pandemic is possible during the partial lifting of the national lockdown. After the partial lifting of the lockdown, if R 0 is as high as 1.5, then a second wave will lead to 60 thousand deaths by mid-July and over a million by October, while if R 0 is 1.2 or lower, the pandemic is delayed with deaths rising as late as August, allowing for timely governmental response.	3) The analysis fails to follow the age distribution of the hospital data, whereas deaths by COVID-19 increase exponentially with age (as do The left panel shows the 4 super-phases, with R 0 = 1, 1.2, 1.5, and 2, while the right panel shows the 9 phases, with R 0 = 1.2 and 1.5.

RNA viruses have compact multifunctional genomes that frequently contain overlapping genes and non-coding functional elements embedded within protein-coding sequences. Overlapping features often escape detection because it can be difficult to disentangle the multiple roles of the constituent nucleotides via mutational analyses, while high-throughput experimental techniques are often unable to distinguish functional elements from incidental features. However, RNA viruses evolve very rapidly so that, even within a single species, substitutions rapidly accumulate at neutral or near-neutral sites providing great potential for comparative genomics to distinguish the signature of purifying selection. Computationally identified features can then be efficiently targeted for experimental analysis. Here we analyze alignments of protein-coding virus sequences to identify regions where there is a statistically significant reduction in the degree of variability at synonymous sites, a characteristic signature of overlapping functional elements. Having previously tested this technique by experimental verification of discoveries in selected viruses, we now analyze sequence alignments for ∼700 RNA virus species to identify hundreds of such regions, many of which have not been previously described.

Probiotics have reduced viral infections in children attending day care. Limited data are available on the effects of probiotics on the nasopharyngeal presence of respiratory viruses. Objectives: To assess, whether probiotics could decrease nasopharyngeal occurrence of respiratory viruses in Finnish conscripts. Study design: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 90-and 150-day intervention study, 239 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 192 symptomatic conscripts receiving daily chewable probiotic tablet containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 (46.9%) or control tablet (53.1%) on visits to a garrison's health care center due to symptoms of infection. The presence of respiratory viruses was tested by PCR-methods, and viral findings were compared between the intervention groups. Results: 184 (76.9%) nasopharyngeal samples were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Picornaviruses were the most common viruses and were detected in 155 (84.2%) of samples. Of these, 143 (92.3%) were rhinovirus-positive and 20 (12.9%) were enterovirus-positive. The control group had 83 (64%) and the probiotic group 72 (66%) picornavirus infections (p = 0.79). Monthly distribution of picornaviruses showed that there were less picornavirus findings after 3 months in the probiotic group than in the control group (p = 0.0069). However, probiotics did not reduce picornavirus occurrence in other months. Conclusions: Overall, probiotics did not reduce viral occurrence in symptomatic conscripts. However, probiotics decreased the presence of picornaviruses after 3 months, which may imply that probiotics play a role against viruses causing common cold. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the mechanisms involved in order to target specific probiotics on specific respiratory viruses.	Acute upper respiratory tract infections, also known as the common cold, are mainly caused by rhinoviruses. Due to its many different serotypes, developing a vaccine for rhinoviruses is unlikely. Other preventive and clinically useful measures, which should be simple, low cost, and without adverse reactions are needed in order to effectively control these infections. Along with proper hand hygiene, probiotic therapy could be an attractive and safe alternative in the prevention or alleviation of rhinovirus infections. In the present study, we observed fewer picornaviruses, predominantly rhinoviruses, in nasopharyngeal samples of military conscripts after 3 months use of probiotics L. rhamnosus GG and B. lactis BB-12. However, this reducing effect was not seen in the total number of picornavirus findings or in other months studied. Further studies revealing specific antiviral mechanism of probiotics L. rhamnosus GG and B. lactis BB-12 against rhinoviruses are warranted.|

Historically, trauma pneumonectomy (TP) mortality rates ranged between 53 and 100%. It is unclear if contemporary mortality rates have improved. Therefore, we evaluated outcomes associated with TP and limited lung resections (LLR) (i.e., lobectomy and segmentectomy) and aimed to identify predictors of mortality, hypothesizing that TP is associated with greater mortality versus LLR. We queried the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010-2016) and performed a multivariable logistic regression to determine the independent predictors of mortality in TLI patients undergoing TP versus LLR. TLI occurred in 287,276 patients. Of these, 889 required lung resection with 758 (85.3%) undergoing LLR and 131 (14.7%) undergoing TP. Patients undergoing TP had a higher median injury severity score (26.0 vs. 24.5, p = 0.03) but no difference in initial median systolic blood pressure (109 vs. 107 mmHg, p = 0.92) compared to LLR. Mortality was significantly higher for TP compared to LLR (64.9% vs 27.2%, p < 0.001). The strongest independent predictor for mortality was undergoing TP versus LLR (OR 4.89, CI 3.18-7.54, p < 0.001). TP continues to be associated with a higher mortality compared to LLR. Furthermore, TP is independently associated with a fivefold increased risk of mortality compared to LLR. Future investigations should focus on identifying parameters or treatment modalities that improve survivability after TP. We recommend that surgeons reserve TP as a last-resort management given the continued high morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure.

The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks.

594	db191fefdbf3f6c4555e62145552cd7bccef1811	Design and performance testing of quantitative real time PCR assays for influenza A and B viral load measurement	Background: The antiviral effect of anti-influenza drugs such as zanamivir may be demonstrated in patients as an increased rate of decline in viral load over a time course of treatment as compared with placebo. Historically this was measured using plaque assays, or Culture Enhanced Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (CE-ELISA). Objectives: to develop and characterise real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to measure influenza A and B viral load in clinical samples, that offer improvements over existing methods, in particular virus infectivity assays. Study design: The dynamic range and robustness were established for the real time qPCR assays along with stability of the assay components. Cross validation of the real time PCR assays with CE-ELISA was performed by parallel testing of both serial dilutions of three different subtypes of cultured virus and a panel of influenza positive throat swab specimens. Results: the assays were specific for influenza A and B and the dynamic ranges were at least seven logs. The assay variability was within acceptable limits but increased towards the lower limit of quantification, which was 3.33 log 10 viral cDNA copies/ml of virus transport medium (ten viral RNA copies/PCR). The components of the assay were robust enough to withstand extended storage and several freeze-thaw cycles. For the real time PCR assays the limit of quantification was equivalent to the virus infectivity cut off, which equates to a 93-fold increase in sensitivity. Conclusion: Well characterised real time PCR assays offer significant improvements over the existing methods for measuring the viral load of strains of influenza A and B in clinical specimens.	Using the real time qPCR assays described above in a routine setting for throat swab screening confirms that it allows, rapid throughput of a high number of samples generating reliable quantitative results and with greater sensitivity than has been achieved by previous commonly used influenza assays. Large-scale screening and identification of influenza virus using real time qPCR has been carried out as part of the development of zanamivir. This new approach should also help to further knowledge of the dynamics of influenza virus infection and the effect of novel therapies on influenza viral load.|
595	6037a68877de95ae30afe19d82228d12a3b81f5b	Genomic characterization and pathogenicity of porcine deltacoronavirus strain CHN-HG-2017 from China	Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first detected in Hong Kong and has recently spread to many countries around the world. PDCoV causes acute diarrhea and vomiting in pigs, resulting in significant economic losses in the global pork industry. In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HG-2017, was isolated from feces of a suckling piglet with severe watery diarrhea on a farm located in central China. Subsequently, the virus was identified by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-HG-2017 is 97.6%-99.1% identical to other PDCoV strains. Analysis of potential recombination sites showed that CHN-HG-2017 is a possible recombinant originating from the strains CH/SXD1/2015 and Vietnam/HaNoi6/2015. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of this recombinant PDCoV strain was investigated in 5-day-old piglets by oral inoculation. The challenged piglets developed typical symptoms, such as vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea and lethargy, from 1 to 7 days post-inoculation (DPI). Viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs until 14 DPI in the challenged piglets. Interestingly, high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies in sera were detected at 21 DPI. Tissues of small intestines from CHN-HG-2017-infected piglets at 4 DPI displayed significant macroscopic and microscopic lesions with clear viral antigen expression. Our analysis of the full genome sequence of a recombinant PDCoV and its virulence in suckling piglets might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of PDCoV and facilitate further investigation of this newly emerged pathogen.	In conclusion, we successfully isolated, characterized and obtained a high titer of CHN-HG-2017 in cultured cells. We showed that CHN-HG-2017 is probably a recombinant virus derived from CH/SXD1/2015 and Vietnam/HaNoi6/2015. Pathogenicity testing of CHN-HG-2017 revealed that this virus is still pathogenic in piglets despite multiple passages in cultured cells. High levels of serum VN antibodies were also detected in sera of infected animals. Not only will our findings be useful for understanding the molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of PDCoV, but they also provide insights for the development of effective vaccines against this important pathogen. |

Mutations of its genomic RNA frequently occur during viral replication, which is believed to be a force contributing to viral evolution. Nevertheless, accumulating evidences show that some JEV strains may have actually arisen from RNA recombination between genetically different populations of the virus. We have demonstrated that RNA recombination in JEV occurs unequally in different cell types. In the present study, viral RNA fragments transfected into as well as viral RNAs synthesized in mosquito cells were shown not to be stable, especially in the early phase of infection possibly via cleavage by exoribonuclease. Such cleaved small RNA fragments may be further degraded through an RNA interference pathway triggered by viral double-stranded RNA during replication in mosquito cells, resulting in a lower frequency of RNA recombination in mosquito cells compared to that which occurs in mammalian cells. In fact, adjustment of viral RNA to an appropriately lower level in mosquito cells prevents overgrowth of the virus and is beneficial for cells to survive the infection. Our findings may also account for the slower evolution of arboviruses as reported previously.	"innate immunity in mammalian cells [45] . On the other hand, dsRNAs formed in invertebrate cells are usually cleaved to be siRNA that consequently degrades viral RNAs [46] , leading to RNAi-mediated innate immunity [47] . Small RNAs ranging from 10 to 24 mer have been identified in C6/36 cells infected by West Nile virus [43] . We have also detected normal expression of Dicer-2 in C6/36 cells infected by JEV for 12 h although it was almost half of inhibition at 6 hpi (data not shown). As a result, dsRF-RNA of the JEV may have a great potential for viral RNA degradation at least in the early phase of infection in mosquito cells. This adjustment of RNA amount is believed to be the way for a delay in RNA accumulation and thus a lower frequency of RNA recombination of the JEV. In contrast, dsRNAs are recognized as a central component of IFN and therefore are incapable of mediating RNAi in mammalian cells [48] . Eventually, our results have shown that protection of RNA from RNase cleavage increases the efficiency of RNA recombination particularly in mammalian cells. RNA recombination creates advantageous genotypes by evolutionary jumps [30] , which permits the removal of deleterious genes based on the notion of ""Muller's ratchet"" from the host cell, usually mammalian cells [12] . Notably, viral RNAs usually accumulated at a lower amount in mosquito cells through RNase cleavage as well as RNA-mediated pathways, leading to stagnancy of RNA recombination which may brake evolution of the JEV and probably most, if not all, arboviruses which are maintained in nature by alternate cycles involving mosquitoes and vertebrates [28] .|"

Studies support the use of steroids for the treatment of exacerbations of COPD and acute asthma, as both conditions are increasingly recognized as infl ammatory syndromes. 1,2 Short courses of systemic steroids have been shown to improve spirometric and clinical outcomes in patients with COPD exacerbations, although patients with documented viral infections have not been studied. 3,4 Precipitants of exacerbations of COPD and asthma include infection, environmental irritants, and allergens. Although corticosteroids reduce infl ammation, long-term use has clear detrimental Rationale: Systemic glucocorticosteroids (steroids) are commonly prescribed for patients with exacerbations of COPD during acute viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to RSV have not been examined in adults. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to measure peak viral load and duration of viral shedding, serum and nasal cytokines, RSV-specifi c antibody response, and lymphocyte subsets in patients admitted to the hospital with RSV infection and to compare patients treated with steroids to patients untreated with steroids.	The primary adverse effect of steroid use appeared to be a modestly diminished serum and secretory antibody response. Although differences were only statistically signifi cant in serum-neutralizing titers against group A virus and nasal antibody to the F protein, it is likely that a larger sample size would have yielded signifi cant differences in other parameters as well. High levels of serum and nasal RSV antibody have been shown to be protective from infection and severe disease in adults, although a specifi c protective antibody titer is not known. 19, 25 Therefore, lower postinfection titers may leave steroid-treated patients more susceptible to future RSV exposures. However, the absolute differences in postinfection antibody titers we observed were relatively small, making the clinical implications of these fi ndings uncertain. The diminished antibody response in the steroid group was not explained by a signifi cant reduction in the number of B lymphocytes, ASCs, or CD4 1 T-cell lymphocytes. However, it is possible that function or activation was impaired despite no discernible difference in cell numbers or subsets. In addition, we did not measure RSV-specifi c T-cell responses or ASC, which side effects. Since specifi c respiratory viral infections, with the exception of infl uenza, are rarely diagnosed in adults, and steroids are commonly prescribed for acute exacerbations of COPD, these data are reassur-ing. A modestly diminished humoral response may predispose patients to future RSV infections, but this risk must be balanced with the immediate antiinfl ammatory effects and potential clinical benefi ts.|

Whether CypA is also involved in the RNA synthesis activity of other nidoviruses warrants further investigation, e.g. by testing Cyp inhibitors on the activity of isolated replication complexes from nidovirus-infected cells. In any case, the mechanistic details of the interactions of nidoviral proteins and Cyps remain to be resolved, which may also provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches for other (nido)viruses that recruit Cyps as a host factor in their replication.|

Since it employs a diversity of building materials, nanomaterials can be employed to enhance the materials' performances, durability, longevity and sustainability. The construction and building practice is detrimental to the environment in various aspects such as electricity consumption, landfill accumulation, unhealthy aesthetics and neighborhoods. This chapter shows how nanotechnology-based building materials are playing an important role in green architectural design and construction, which has become a growing trend in many countries. Nanomaterials could be integrated with cement, concrete, or windows to conserve energy, minimize electricity bills and sanitize the surrounding atmosphere. Nevertheless, the industry is still facing many hurdles towards the wide application of nanomaterials in a cost effective manner.

We performed a pilot cross sectional study to assess the feasibility of gas-capillary column ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS), for the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in exhaled breath to diagnose bacterial RTI in hospital inpatients.	"Aggregate bacterial RTI"" and ""other RTI"" groups. The problem of low rates of identification of a causative organism is one that is common in both LRTI aetiology studies and clinical care [17] . Thirdly, because of the exploratory nature of this study small numbers precluded an analysis that takes into account diseases that are known to affect the VOC profile (diabetes mellitus, COPD, etc.). Fourthly, a decision was made not to use a wash-in (where the participant breathes clean or scrubbed air prior to exhaling into the device), which in principle could have resulted in ambient air VOCs being erroneously attributed to the patient. This decision was made because it may have been uncomfortable for our patient population of interest; that is, patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infection. To mitigate against misattribution of ambient air samples, a sample of room air was collected for each patient. In the event, the background air variations were small. In addition, as the unit uses a GC pre-separation it is likely that interfering molecules will be detected separately to any biomarkers, so a wash in is not critical in this situation. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of the technique are at best modest; it may be that the heterogeneity of the study population, in addition to the factors above, has contributed to this. Notwithstanding these limitations, this pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of beside point VOC in a hospitalized, unselected RTI population. Further clinical studies are needed to validate this technique in much larger patient sets, using comprehensive diagnostic microbiology and robust case definitions agreed by an expert panel. This will enable a distinction to be made between patients with different underlying conditions such as emphysema or diabetes.|"

The negative effect of the lockdown may propagate to other regions through supply chains because of shortage of supply and demand. Applying an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly 1.6 million firms in Japan, we simulate what would happen to production activities outside Tokyo when production activities that are not essential to citizens' survival in Tokyo were shut down for a certain period. We find that when Tokyo is locked down for a month, the indirect effect on other regions would be twice as large as the direct effect on Tokyo, leading to a total production loss of 27 trillion yen in Japan, or 5.3% of its annual GDP. Although the production shut down in Tokyo accounts for 21% of the total production in Japan, the lockdown would result in a reduction of the daily production in Japan by 86% in a month.

Host innate immune response has been implicated in recognition, protection and immune pathological mechanisms. Host-viral interactions are generally initiated via host recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the virus. This recognition occurs through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which are expressed on innate immune cells such as epithelial cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Multiple PRR families, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), contribute significantly to viral detection, leading to induction of cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons (IFNs), which subsequently facilitate the eradication of the virus. This review focuses on the current literature on RSV and hMPV infection and the role of PRRs in establishing/mediating the infection in both in vitro and in vivo models. A better understanding of the complex interplay between these two viruses and host PRRs might lead to efficient prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, as well as the development of adequate vaccines.	In summary, Virus-induced respiratory disease accounts for the majority of hospitalizations of infants and young children and the major viral causes of lower respiratory tract disease are RSV and hMPV in addition to rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3), and influenza. Important progress has been made in the last decade delineating the critical role of several PRRs in RSV and hMPV infections, in terms of recognition of viral proteins and/or RNA by host and subsequent initiation and orchestration of host immune responses. Even though TLRs play a distinct role in mediating RSV/hMPV infections, the role of other PRRs such as RLRs and NLRs is gaining importance. A better understanding of how host recognizes and differentiates these two viruses and mediates cellular signaling and innate and adaptive immune responses is crucial for improving therapeutic approaches and the development of better vaccines against these two important viral pathogens. |

It started out as a great scientifi c endeavor in the 1990s which aimed to sequence the complete genomes of certain biological species. However viruses are not new to this fi eld as complete viral genomes have routinely been sequenced since the past thirty years. The 'genomic era' has been said to have revolutionized biology. This knowledge of full genomes has created the fi eld of functional genomics in today's post-genomic era, which, is in most part concerned with the studies on the expression of the organism's genome under different conditions. This article is an attempt to introduce its readers to the application of functional genomics to address and answer several complex biological issues in virus research.	Functional genomics involves the use of the genome sequence information of an organism coupled with experimentally derived transcriptomics and proteomics data to study the organism as a whole. As reviewed here, such studies further advance our knowledge of basic and applied virology and provide a greater understanding of viral pathogenesis. Functional genomics studies have aided in the development of new viral diagnostics and therapeutics. As more and more viral genomes are sequenced and new more advanced computational tools are made available to analyze, integrate, model and interpret the burgeoning amount of data, new and valuable information about viral systems will emerge. Functional genomics data needs to be made publicly available to hasten the pace of research in this fi eld. Such studies have provided further insight into host and pathogen interactions and will continue to do so in future. Functional genomics studies are increasingly expanding into the boundaries of various traditional biological disciplines. This fi eld is still in its infancy, but growing at a steady rate. |

To reduce this gap, we introduce a generic wavelet shrinkage function for denoising which is adaptive to both the wavelet scales as well as the noise standard deviation. It is inferred from trained results of a tightly parametrised function which is inherited from nonlinear diffusion. Our proposed shrinkage function is smooth and compact while only using two parameters. In contrast to many existing shrinkage functions, it is able to enhance image structures by amplifying wavelet coefficients. Experiments show that it outperforms classical shrinkage functions by a significant margin.	In our ongoing work we extend these findings to other adaptive nonlinear approaches such as diffusion evolutions.|
614	0e12e3191e6ce998f711be57eba12fe211dd3f72	Immunogenicity assay of the Leishmune ® vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil	Leishmune ® is the industrialized version of the FML-saponin vaccine which has been shown to develop 92-95% protection in vaccinated dogs and 76-80% vaccine efficacy against field canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in Brazil. Leishmune ® has been proven to be safe and tolerable and a transmission-blocking vaccine which renders vaccinated dogs non-infectious to sand fly vectors. In the present investigation, 550 healthy seronegative dogs of endemic and epidemic areas of Brazil were monitored for Leishmune ®induced immunogenicity during a 2-year trial. Another group of 588 untreated exposed dogs was also studied in parallel. Both groups were seronegative on day 0. The strong immunogenicity induced by Leishmune ® vaccine was demonstrated by the 98% of FML-seroconversion, increase in absorbencies, the 82.7% DTH positive reactions and increase in skin test size diameters, the average increase in CD8+ total lymphocytes population in blood (27.1%), expected for QS21 saponin-containing vaccine, the sustained proportions of CD4+ T cells, and the average increased proportions of CD21+ B lymphocytes (42.3%). The Leishmune ® -induced protection against CVL is demonstrated by the results: 98.8% asymptomatic dogs (at the end of first year) and 99% healthy survivors (at the end of the second year) among vaccinated dogs, compared to the 79.4% asymptomatic and 61% survivor dogs (p < 0.001) monitored in the untreated exposed cohort. In spite of the low vaccine coverage, it was possible to detect a 66.1% (p < 0.005) reduction in Belo Horizonte and an 80.2% (p < 0.005) reduction in Araç atuba of the incidence of CVL among vaccinated dogs, when compared to the global incidence of CVL of each town, respectively. Our preliminary results support the potential use of Leishmune ® to prevent CVL epidemics.	In this investigation, we have demonstrated the strong immunogenicity of Leishmune ® in healthy exposed dogs in epidemic areas, which consequently exhibit a strong and sustained humoral and cellular immune response against the parasite. A classic Phase III trial, with random double-blind selected controls could not be performed because of the ethical restrictions of the veterinarians from these epidemic areas, who refused to include untreated healthy dogs as exposed controls. Leishmune ® -induced protection against ZVL, is however suggested by the results of 98.8% of asymptomatic dogs (at the end of first year) and 99% healthy survivors (at the end of the second year) among vaccinated dogs, compared to the 79.4% of asymptomatic and 61% survivor dogs monitored in an untreated exposed cohort in another endemic area. Although a vaccine against ZVL is considered an efficient tool for eradication of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis [4] and Leishmune ® is the first vaccine in the world to be licensed against ZVL [16] , its vaccine coverage in Brazil is still very low. In spite of this the incidence of ZVL among vaccinated dogs in Belo Horizonte suffered a significant reduction of 66.1% (p < 0.005), and there was an 80.2% (p < 0.005) significant decline in Araç atuba, when compared to the global incidence of ZVL of both towns, respectively. Thus our preliminary results then support the potential use of Leishmune ® for the prevention of ZVL epidemics.|

We study this in the linear regime where the prevalence is fixed while the number of items is large. We study various nonadaptive test designs for the first stage, and derive a new lower bound for the total number of tests required. We find that a first-stage design with constant tests per item and constant items per test due to Broder and Kumar is extremely close to optimal. Simulations back up the theoretical results.

However, the biochemistry of hematophagy has been studied in a few species of direct medical interest and is still underdeveloped in most invertebrates, as in general is the study of venom toxins. In cone snails, leeches, arthropods and snakes, the strong target specificity of venom toxins uniquely aligns them to industrial and academic pursuits (pharmacological applications, pest control etc.) and provides a biochemical tool for studying biological activities including cell signalling and immunological response. Neogastropod snails (cones, oyster drills etc.) are carnivorous and include active predators, scavengers, grazers on sessile invertebrates and hematophagous parasites; most of them use venoms to efficiently feed. It has been hypothesized that trophic innovations were the main drivers of rapid radiation of Neogastropoda in the late Cretaceous. We present here the first molecular characterization of the alimentary secretion of a non-conoidean neogastropod, Colubraria reticulata. Colubrariids successfully feed on the blood of fishes, throughout the secretion into the host of a complex mixture of anaesthetics and anticoagulants. We used a NGS RNA-Seq approach, integrated with differential expression analyses and custom searches for putative secreted feeding-related proteins, to describe in detail the salivary and mid-oesophageal transcriptomes of this Mediterranean vampire snail, with functional and evolutionary insights on major families of bioactive molecules. Results: A remarkably low level of overlap was observed between the gene expression in the two target tissues, which also contained a high percentage of putatively secreted proteins when compared to the whole body. At least 12 families of feeding-related proteins were identified, including: 1) anaesthetics, such as ShK Toxin-containing proteins and turripeptides (ion-channel blockers), Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), Adenosine Deaminase (ADA); 2) inhibitors of primary haemostasis, such as novel vWFA domain-containing proteins, the Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 5 (ENPP5) and the wasp Antigen-5; 3) anticoagulants, such as TFPI-like multiple Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, Peptidases S1 (PS1), CAP/ShKT domain-containing proteins, Astacin metalloproteases and Astacin/ShKT domain-containing proteins; 4) additional proteins, such the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE: vasopressive) and the cytolytic Porins. Conclusions: Colubraria feeding physiology seems to involve inhibitors of both primary and secondary haemostasis, anaesthetics, a vasoconstrictive enzyme to reduce feeding time and tissue-degrading proteins such as Porins and Astacins. The complexity of Colubraria venomous cocktail and the divergence from the arsenal of the few neogastropods studied to date (mostly conoideans) suggest that biochemical diversification of neogastropods might be largely underestimated and worth of extensive investigation.	Salivary (935 contigs), oesophageal (184 contigs) and whole body (1048 contigs) catalogues were also manually translated using Virtual Ribosome -version 1.1 server [126] and only peptides starting with Met were considered. The probability to encode for a signal peptide was evaluated using two on-line prediction servers (SignalP and PrediSi) [37, 38] .|

In the assistive robotics domain, the human-machine interaction plays a substantial role. Especially, the humans generate intents that affect robot control system.

The whole approach was applied to the real system consisting of customised TIAGo robot and additional hardware components. The exemplary experiments performed on the platform illustrate the motivation for diversification of human-machine interfaces in assistive robots.	The recent problems in our world let to the conclusion that high effort should be put to assistive robots research not only because of the ageing population of the developed countries. The number of worldwide diseases showed a need to help people that have to be isolated or simultaneously are temporarily or continuously disabled. The robots can radically improve the situation even with simple applications like transportation or guarding. Such robots should communicate with patients in various ways to achieve reliable service of e.g. people that can not operate with hands or have problems with speaking. An approach proposed in this work, helps to develop control systems with the above assumptions. Currently, it used in the TIAGo robot based system to help the Elderly in the various scenarios that include transportation attendance, guarding, fall prevention and hazard detection [22] .|
620	0d82c429737f250a7bcd230fea2e4725edc2439a	viruses The Interaction between Nidovirales and Autophagy Components	Autophagy is a conserved intracellular catabolic pathway that allows cells to maintain homeostasis through the degradation of deleterious components via specialized double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. During the past decades, it has been revealed that numerous pathogens, including viruses, usurp autophagy in order to promote their propagation. Nidovirales are an order of enveloped viruses with large single-stranded positive RNA genomes. Four virus families (Arterividae, Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Roniviridae) are part of this order, which comprises several human and animal pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. In host cells, Nidovirales induce membrane rearrangements including autophagosome formation. The relevance and putative mechanism of autophagy usurpation, however, remain largely elusive. Here, we review the current knowledge about the possible interplay between Nidovirales and autophagy.	While it is indisputable that large part of the investigated Nidovirales induces autophagy in host cells, it still remains unclear whether this is due to a subversion of autophagy by the virus or whether it is a physiological response to the cellular stress caused by either the infection or the transfection of single viral proteins. Future research should therefore also focus on the identification of a potential direct molecular link between viral and ATG proteins. Such studies could also pave the way to the development of novel antiviral therapies targeting the virus-autophagy interaction.|

Businesses increasingly require more qualified IT professionals, be they male or female. In South Africa, the number of women professionals participating in the IT industry is less than 20%. A number of factors influence women's IT career choices, such as previous programming exposure, parents, teachers and role models. Research suggests that there are gender differences in preferences and beliefs that may affect career choices, including cultural influences. The role of culture in women's IT career decisions has not been extensively explored in South Africa. The aim of this exploratory study was to determine if the factor, Culture influences women's IT career choices in South Africa. An on-line survey was conducted amongst women IT professionals in South Africa to determine the factors that influenced their IT career choices. The data from the survey were analysed using Exploratory Factor Analysis. The results, specifically relating to the factor Culture, are reported in this paper. The findings indicate that the factor Culture plays an important role when women make IT career choices as well as when females decide to remain in an IT career. The study found that culture does play a significant role in IT career decisions for different ethnic groups in South Africa. The findings suggest that efforts must be made to educate young women in computational thinking and expose them to the many career opportunities available for women in the IT industry.	This exploratory study has provided the foundation for evaluating Woman in IT career choices in South Africa and the influence of the factor Culture on the career choices and remaining in the IT industry. Future research will investigate the role of culture in women's IT career choices in more detail, by obtaining a larger sample size and evaluating the views of men as well. The study will be extended internationally and compare the South African results with other countries.|
622	35e9c75424f8bfe88bfeadf917721a4c79728476		Although the recent SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that appeared in 2002 has now been contained, the possibility of re-emergence of SARS-CoV remains. Due to the threat of re-emergence, the overall fatality rate of¨10%, and the rapid dispersion of the virus via international travel, viable vaccine candidates providing protection from SARS are clearly needed. We developed an attenuated VSV recombinant (VSV-S) expressing the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein. In cells infected with this recombinant, S protein was synthesized, glycosylated at approximately 17 Asn residues, and transported via the Golgi to the cell surface. Mice vaccinated with VSV-S developed SARS-neutralizing antibody and were able to control a challenge with SARS-CoV performed at 1 month or 4 months after a single vaccination. We also demonstrated, by passive antibody transfer, that the antibody response induced by the vaccine was sufficient for controlling SARS-CoV infection. A VSV-vectored SARS vaccine could have significant advantages over other SARS vaccine candidates described to date. D	Sera from mice immunized with wt VSV, VSV-S, and SARS-CoV were collected and heat inactivated. Two groups of six mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 500 Al of wt VSV or VSV-S immune sera. Two additional groups of six mice were also injected i.p. with 500 Al of SARS immune sera diluted 1:10 in PBS or sera of naïve mice. Serum was collected from each mouse to determine neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV . Mice were then inoculated i.n. with 10 5 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV. Two days later, the lungs were collected from each mouse, and viral titer was determined as described above.|

Both SARS Coronavirus which quickly spread to 29 countries in February 2003 and H1N1 swine influenza that recently spread from Mexico to 30 countries in three weeks represent major pandemic threats for mankind. Diagnostic assays are required to detect novel influenza strains with pandemic potential.	The emergence of H1N1 swine influenza has provided a real life challenge for the RVP test to detect new pandemic strains. The xTAG ™ RVP successfully flagged 20 out of 20 swine flu patients as having non-seasonal influenza while at the same time correctly identified seasonal influenza (8 H1N1 and 14 H3N2), 3 parainfluenza type 3, 6 rhino/enterovirus, 2 coronavirus 229E, and 1 metapneumovirus infections in Hamilton during the month of April. By running the test daily as a sentinel test, we have been able to provide public health authorities with a probable swine flu result with a 24 h turn around time faster than that provided by our Public Health Laboratories. While laboratories rush to build H1N1 swine flu specific assays, currently available molecular tests such as the xTAG ™ RVP assay provide a solution for detecting swine flu cases in the absence of specific H1N1 swine flu tests. We believe that the RVP test if implemented in diagnostic algorithms can play an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza A viruses in patients presenting with ILI and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats. |

This chapter provides insights into the physiological receptors that are associated with the genesis, progression, metastasis, management, as well as the prognosis of the cancers of the male and female reproductive systems. It also highlights the structural and binding characteristics of the highly predominant receptors, namely, androgen, estrogen, progesterone, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors, which are overexpressed in these cancers and discusses various strategies to target them.	Carcinogenesis in the different organs of the reproductive system, particularly, prostate, ovarian, and cervical tissues, involves aberrant expression of various physiological receptors belonging to different superfamilies. Structural and pharmacological role of four predominant receptors, namely, AR, ER, PR (sex steroid nuclear receptors), and GnRHR (GPCRs) has been highlighted in this chapter. Moreover, strategies and molecules developed for targeting these receptors, for formulating clinically relevant anticancer therapeutics, have been put forth and supported by the ongoing preclinical and clinical studies. We speculate that a combinatorial therapy comprising receptor-targeted ligands/agents, with clinically acceptable cytotoxic drugs, as well as targeting moieties such as antibodies (antibody-drug conjugates) and use of nano-and novel carriers for drug delivery, will enhance the overall antineoplastic effect. Considerable research has been conducted in deciphering the role of the AR and GnRHR in the cancers of the reproductive system and efforts to target these receptors have been commenced. We anticipate similar investigations to be conducted for ER and PR receptors in the near future.|

Based on sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions, a generalized structural model for the ATP-binding core is proposed. It is suggested that all these proteins constitute a superfamily of hehcases (or helicase subunits) involved in NTP-dependent duplex unwinding during DNA and RNA replication and recombination.	During the final stage of the preparation of this manuscript we learned that T.C. Hodgman had in-dependently reached very similar conclusions [36] and additionally included in his treatise a yeast helicase, whose sequence has been demonstrated very recently to be related to that of uvrD [37] .

The early parasite detection is one of the effective means to prevent severe malaria of which specific treatment strategies are limited. Many clinical characteristics and laboratory testings have been used for the early diagnosis and prediction of severe disease. However, a few of these factors could be applied to clinical practice. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were demonstrated as useful biomarkers in many diseases such as malignant diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Recently it was found that plasma miR-451 and miR-16 were downregulated in malaria infection at parasitic stages or with multi-organ failure involvement. MiR-125b, -27a, -23a, -150, 17-92 and -24 are deregulated in malaria patients with multiple organ failures. Here, the current findings of miRNAs were reviewed in relation to clinical severity of malaria infection and emphasized that miRNAs are potential biomarkers for severe malaria infection.	A useful biomarker has to be an investigation, with high sensitivity, non-invasive and applicable to clinical management. There are more studies about miRNAs as a biomarker in many diseases, most of them related to malignant and cardiovascular diseases. For tropical infectious diseases, the knowledge of miRNAs raises to fill to explain the pathophysiology of diseases. The knowledge of miRNAs in malaria infection is still not enough if compared with antimalaria drug trial. The more studies were required to answer, (1) biomarker to predict malaria severity and further predictor, (2) development of the new treatment directed to malaria life cycle. Further studies will perform to fill the gap between bench and bed by accumulating knowledge in serious complications among malaria patients.|

[27] To this end, X-DNA motifs and plasmid vectors containing a proteinencoding gene, all of which bore the same palindromic sticky ends, were enzymatically ligated to produce a DNA hydrogel ( Figure 2) . Gelation was carried out in molds, thus enabling the generation of gel pads of 1 mm 1 mm 20 mm dimensions. To function as templates for in vitro protein production, the pads were then immersed in a cell-free reagent cocktail containing the necessary components for protein biosynthesis, such as RNA polymerase and ribosomes. Expression of different functional proteins demonstrated that the gel pad system was up to three hundred times more effective than solution-based synthesis, which is the standard approach of in vitro protein synthesis. Notably, the porosity of the gels could be altered by varying the stoichiometric ratio of genes to X-DNA monomers, and it was shown that such variations affected the protein production capabilities of the gels. However, the reasons for this effectiveness are not yet entirely clear. It seems that in addition to high concentrations and close proximity of genes in the hydrogels, which increases turnover rate of biosynthetic machinery, the genes are also protected against degradation by covalent cross-linking with the X-DNA motifs. [27] It also seems possible that the high ionic strength inside the hydrogel matrix may play an important role in increasing the polymerases enzymatic activity. [28] Although the exploitation of fundamental mechanisms will require additional studies, this work suggests a number of applications, ranging from commercial kit-like products for cell-free protein synthesis to long-term perspectives in the arising field of synthetic biology, in which ""minimal cells"" are targeted. [29] Since cell-free protein expression of a multitude of proteins has been used to engineer metabolic pathways in vitro, [30] it seems possible that hydrogel-containing vesicles could be an option to replace genomic DNA in synthetic systems and thus engineer higher functional complexity in synthetic biological systems. [28] Altogether, the recent developments in DNA-based dendrimer research summarized herein promise exciting new directions in nanobiotechnology, in which new materials may be used for bioanalytical and biomedical applications.|"

Methods: RT-qPCR assays and molecular sequencing methods were used to identify HRV and HEV strains in nasopharyngeal aspirates of 309 hospitalized pediatric patients with microbiologically unexplained ARTIs and in 210 hospitalized pediatric patients without respiratory symptoms from September 2009 to June 2010 in France. Results: Among the 309 ARTI cases, 15 HEV and 172 HRV strains were identified whereas only 1 HEV and 37 HRV strains were observed in control patients (187 vs. 38: P < 10 À3 ). HRV strains were identified in 150 of the 164 lower ARTIs whereas HEV strains were identified in only 14 of these cases. Among bronchiolitis and asthma exacerbation cases (n Z 133), HEV infected cases were older (Median age (months) 36 vs. 11, P Z 0.003) and were more frequently associated with a respiratory distress (P Z 0.01) and a need for oxygen supply at the time of admission (P Z 0.01) than cases infected by HRV strains. Conclusion: HRV and HEV strains were identified as potential etiological causes of 60.5% of microbiologically unexplained ARTIs diagnosed in hospitalized pediatric cases. A higher clinical severity was observed in HEV infected bronchiolitis or asthma exacerbation cases in comparison to HRV infected cases.	The authors have non conflict of interest to declare.|

Reconciling the beneficial activity of shuttling RNA helicases to retroviruses with the antiviral activity of cytosolic helicases that oppose other RNA viruses remains to be fully understood. From the vantage point of a retrovirus, RNA helicases are cofactors required to transcribe provirus DNA, stimulate transcriptional elongation and RNA processing, and facilitate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of retroviral RNPs to become translated. From the vantage point of a cell, RNA helicases are antiviral sensors, detecting nonself-RNA in the cytoplasm and triggering an antiviral state. However, retroviruses circumvent these cellular RNA sensors, instead co-opting nuclear RNA helicases and using them in a manner analogous to cellular transcripts, dissipating the restrictive activity of RNA helicases that actively thwarts cytoplasmic replication of many other RNA viruses.|

Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening.	Lack of timeliness in reporting makes the IDSR system inoperative. Differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice existed in the current Malawian context. Shortcomings were due to financial constraints and poor basic infrastructure. However, the improving information technology infrastructure in Malawi, single country platform EMR system and emerging mHealth technologies can be opportunities for the country to overcome the challenges and improve the surveillance system. . .

ESI-cleavable peptide TNT isotopomers were introduced into PNA oligonucleotide sequences in a total synthesis approach. These conjugates were evaluated as hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of immobilized synthetic target DNAs using ESI-MS/MS. In these experiments, the PNA portion of the conjugate acts as a hybridization probe, whereas the peptide TNT is released in a collision-based process during the ionization of the probe conjugate in the electrospray ion source. The cleaved TNT acts as a uniquely resolvable marker to identify and quantify a unique target DNA sequence. The method should be applicable to a wide variety of assays requiring highly multiplexed, quantitative DNA/RNA analysis, including gene expression monitoring, genetic profiling and the detection of pathogens.	The use of TNT-PNA oligonucleotide conjugates offer many of the advantages of fluorescent detection such as high specificity, ease and safety of handling and high sensitivity with the additional unmatched advantages that result from being able to generate large numbers of tags with predefined masses and from being able to construct these sets of tags with stable isotopes generating chemically identical entities that will behave the same in labelling reactions and in separation steps. This means that multiplexed analyses with accurate quantification are now enabled in a user-friendly format. Future experiments will be directed towards evaluation of the TNT-PNA probes for post-PCR amplicon detection. In addition, the development of TNT-DNA oligonucleotide conjugates and evaluation of these probes as primers for multiplexed PCR amplification and subsequent detection of PCR amplicons will also be pursued. The ability to employ in-line capillary electrophoresis with immediate cleavage and detection of tags will be of particular interest as many genomics assays, such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, satellite marker analysis and multiplexed PCR employ size separations and the ability to perform such analyses with the higher levels of multiplexing enabled by this technology will be of great advantage.|

Once posted, changes to the schedule require voluntary participation by the nurses, making it difficult for hospitals to respond to changes in nursing needs and availability of nurses. At the same time, nursing needs' forecasts developed several weeks in advance are often wrong. In each hospital setting, there may exist several promising strategies to enhance scheduling flexibility and reduce the mismatch between the nursing needs and the availability of nurses. However, methodologies to evaluate such strategies, before testing them in expensive pilot implementation, do not exist. We demonstrate how such evaluations can be carried out using historical data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of our approach by evaluating the benefits of a strategy where nurses are divided into two cohorts and schedules are phase shifted for the two cohorts. Staggering schedules allows nursing unit managers to benefit from more frequent updating of needs' assessments without having to change work rules. Upon applying our approach to data from a large urban hospital, we discovered that in this example staggering did not improve the performance of nurse schedules. We discuss possible reasons for this result, its implications for hospital managers, and other potential uses of our approach.	i ∈ {3,5} K k=1 (r i,j,k + e i,j,k + o i,j,k ) + ı 3,j + ı 5,j ≥ d 3,j ∀j = 1, . . . , 7 (e) Other constraints.

In some outbreaks, the intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX, New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N = 20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an authority figure genuinely working in the community's interests. They received timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal autonomy, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems with community consent in an era of growing social media use and mistrust in governmental and scientific authority. They also debated whether health authorities should use moral-based arguments, in addition to science-based ones, to communicate aerial spraying's risks and benefits.

Despite a large body of evidence supporting mutagenesis as a conceivable antiviral strategy, there are currently no data on the sensitivity to increased mutagenesis for Zika virus (ZIKV) and Usutu virus (USUV), two emerging flaviviral threats. In this study, we demonstrate that both viruses are sensitive to three ribonucleosides, favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil, that have shown mutagenic activity against other RNA viruses while remaining unaffected by a mutagenic deoxyribonucleoside. Serial cell culture passages of ZIKV in the presence of these compounds resulted in the rapid extinction of infectivity, suggesting elevated sensitivity to mutagenesis. USUV extinction was achieved when a 10-fold dilution was applied between every passage, but not in experiments involving undiluted virus, indicating an overall lower susceptibility than ZIKV. Although the two viruses are inhibited by the same three drugs, ZIKV is relatively more susceptive to serial passage in the presence of purine analogues (favipiravir and ribavirin), while USUV replication is suppressed more efficiently by 5-fluorouracil. These differences in sensitivity typically correlate with the increases in the mutation frequencies observed in each nucleoside treatment. These results are relevant to the development of efficient therapies based on lethal mutagenesis and support the rational selection of different mutagenic nucleosides for each pathogen. We will discuss the implications of these results to the fidelity of flavivirus replication and the design of antiviral therapies based on lethal mutagenesis.

649	0b30e970d817fdc264c7e6f61eda62e29775e650	Animal Health Research Reviews Bovine-like coronaviruses in domestic and wild ruminants	Coronaviruses (CoVs) produce a wide spectrum of disease syndromes in different mammalian and avian host species. These viruses are well-recognized for their ability to change tissue tropism, to hurdle the interspecies barriers and to adapt ecological variations. It is predicted that the inherent genetic diversity of CoVs caused by accumulation of point mutations and high frequency of homologous recombination is the principal determinant of these competences. Several CoVs (e.g. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) have been recorded to cross the interspecies barrier, inducing different disease conditions in variable animal hosts. Bovine CoV (BCoV) is a primary cause of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease in cattle calves, winter dysentery in lactating cows and shipping fever pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Although it has long been known as a restrictive cattle pathogen, CoVs that are closely related to BCoV have been recognized in dogs, humans and in other ruminant species. Biologic, antigenic and genetic analyses of the so-called 'bovine-like CoVs' proposed classification of these viruses as host-range variants rather than distinct virus species. In this review, the different bovine-like CoVs that have been identified in domesticated ruminants (water buffalo, sheep, goat, dromedary camel, llama and alpaca) and wild ruminants (deer, wild cattle, antelopes, giraffes and wild goats) are discussed in terms of epidemiology, transmission and virus characteristics. The presented data denote the importance of these viruses in the persistence of BCoV in nature, spread to new geographical zones, and continuous emergence of disease epidemics in cattle farms.	Bovine-like CoVs are widely distributed in domestic ruminants other than cattle and in captive and free-range wild ruminant species. The majority of bovine-like CoVs have confirmed close relationship with different BCoV strains that produce gastroenteritis in neonatal calves and lactating cows, and respiratory disease complex in growing and steer calves. It is generally accepted today that bovine-like CoVs are host-range variants of BCoV, which is crossing the interspecies barriers on a regular basis. Transmission of BCoV variants from cattle to other ruminants and vice versa allows persistence of the infection in nature, recurrent emergence of epidemics and continuous evolution of the virus. Wild ruminants, in particular, are not confined to discrete geographic regions and are always moving to seek new pastures, to escape from predators, and to find mates. Human activities, includingbut not restricted todeforestation, over-hunting and game farming, also force wild animals to change habitats. Continuous movement of wild animals promotes virus transmission to new terrestrial areas, and, importantly, provides a window for the virus to adapt to new hosts and to develop into novel strains.|

Analysis of a two-wave online panel survey found that traditional media use had a positive influence on MERS knowledge while social media use did not. However, knowledge did not facilitate preventive behaviors. In contrast, negative emotional responses due to media use stimulated desirable behaviors. Furthermore, social media use directly influenced behavioral responses but traditional media use did not show the same effects. Different functions of traditional and social media during an epidemic are discussed.	Mihye Seo https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5734-3181|

The impacts of climate change on water resources, hydrological processes, the cryosphere, and ocean hydrological processes are analyzed, as well as the impacts on land ecosystems, desertification, and soil erosion. The impact of global sea-level change on marine ecology and the coastal environment is 69 comprehensively assessed. The chapter also summarized the impact of climate change on farming, animal husbandry, forestry, aquaculture, and fisheries.	Highways and high-speed rails are national transportation artery, facing with high rick of ice, snow, rain, fog, lightning, high temperature, and other inclement weather. Therefore, highways need to strengthen monitoring of meteorological information, timely adjustment of the construction and the operation plan. High-speed rails need to take measures to adapt to the impacts of climate change and focus on prevention of meteorological disasters in the key seasons and areas. South transmission line had been experienced serious loss in the 2008 snow and ice storms. Accompanied by the projected increasing in the probability of extreme weather events, south transmission lines need to strengthen prevention and protection on freezing rain, improve disaster warning, and other measures, enhancing the ability to adapt to climate change.|

PCV-2 are small single-stranded circular DNA viruses clustered into two main genogroups: PCV-2a and PCV-2b. Each genogroup present a specific highly-conserved motif of six amino acids (between amino acids 86 and 91) in the PCV-2 capsid protein. The aim of this study was to verify whether the motif located in the capsid protein and specific to each PCV-2 genogroup contributes to virulence. Two parental DNA clones, PCV-2a and PCV-2b, were constructed as well as two mutants DNA clones, PCV-2a/motif 2b and PCV-2b/motif 2a by exchanging the capsid motif of each genogroup. The four DNA clones were characterized in vitro as well as in vivo. Cells transfected by the four DNA clones produced infectious viruses. In specific-pathogen-free piglets transfected by the four infectious DNA clones, PCV-2b/motif 2a virulence was not attenuated while the PCV-2a/motif 2b virulence was drastically reduced compared to their parent virulence. These results suggest that the amino acids between positions 86 and 91 of the capsid protein are determinant for the virulence of isolates. However, the environment of this motif seems also involved.	In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the PCV-2b isolate presented different characteristics from the PCV-2a isolate and the virulence of PCV-2 seemed to involve the capsid and more particularly the genogroup motif and its background, but not only.|

Once a model has been calibrated, it can be used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators for such predictions. However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from such models will vary widely, depending on the particular parameter values employed within the range that give a good fit. When data are poor or incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full range of parameter estimates contained in the parameters' posterior distribution to adjust for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given the epidemiological model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior distribution of model's parameters to generate all possible epidemiological curves, which are encapsulated in posterior predictive distributions. From these, one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of implementing contingency plans according to this assessment. We apply this approach to the potential evolution of COVID-19 in Mexico City and assess whether contingency plans are being successful and whether the epidemiological curve has flattened.	As for future work, there are a number of avenues we are currently exploring, both theoretical from the modelling side and practical, as a predictive tool. For instance, we will shortly explore the likely impact for Mexico City of lifting Sanitary Emergency measures too soon. Clearly, we plan to extend this analysis to other regions of Mexico.|

This chapter also includes definitions of important terms used in infectious disease epidemiology.	Another pressing area of research for infectious disease epidemiology comes from the ability of pathogens to escape intervention pressure by evolutionary adaptation. For example, the development of resistance of pathogens against treatments (antibiotic resistance, resistance against antiviral medication) is causing increasing problems not only in hospitals, where multiresistant strains of pathogens have become endemic, but also in the treatment of tuberculosis and chronic hepatitis B.|

When tidal volume (V T ) is kept constant, ΔP may change according to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced changes in lung aeration. ΔP may decrease if PEEP leads to a recruitment of collapsed lung tissue but will increase if PEEP mainly causes pulmonary overdistension.

The Wellcome Trust-Vietnamese Initiative on Zoonotic Infections (WT-VIZIONS) is aiming to understand the circulation of viral zoonotic pathogens in animals that pose a potential risk to human health. Evidence suggests that human exposure and infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes (GT) 3 and 4 results from zoonotic transmission. Hypothesising that HEV GT3 and GT4 are circulating in the Vietnamese pig population and can be transmitted to humans, we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of HEV exposure in a population of farmers and the general population. We additionally performed sequence analysis of HEV in pig populations in the same region to address knowledge gaps regarding HEV circulation and to evaluate if pigs were a potential source of HEV exposure. We found a high prevalence of HEV GT3 viral RNA in pigs (19.1% in faecal samples and 8.2% in rectal swabs) and a high HEV seroprevalence in pig farmers (16.0%) and a hospital-attending population (31.7%) in southern Vietnam. The hospital population was recruited as a general-population proxy even though this particular population subgroup may introduce bias. The detection of HEV RNA in pigs indicates that HEV may be a zoonotic disease risk in this location, although a larger sample size is required to infer an association between HEV positivity in pigs and seroprevalence in humans.	individuals were grouped into 3-year-age bands for maximum informativeness and clarity. The red line shows the inferred seroprevalence curve, and the pink shaded area shows the 95% confidence band. The grey dots show the seroprevalence for each 3-year-age group, and the size of the dot is proportional to the sample size. |

Disruption of one VEGF allele in mice has revealed a dramatic lethal effect in early embryogenesis, suggesting a key role in vasculogenesis and a very tight level of regulation.	The density of endoglin immunostained blood vessels is prognostic for survival in prostate cancer Endothelial cells represent an attractive source of diagnostic and therapeutic molecular targets during diverse diseases that depend on angiogenesis. Here we use gene expression analysis to find genes that are both relevant and unique to the angiogenic process as defined by an in vitro model. Analysis of the data identified 154 genes that are modulated during the process and 105 genes that enriched for expression in endothelial cells as compared to normal tissues. A subset of 39 genes was found to be common to both groups and of the 21 known genes found in this group, 16 genes have been associated with endothelial cell biology and/or angiogenesis. The identification of a5 integrin in the genes enriched for endothelial cell expression allowed us to further validate our approach. Thus, this study identified a small number of genes fitting defined biological hypotheses that can be assessed as therapeutic targets. Endostatin decreased VEGF-induced formation of endothelial tubes and microvessels sprouting from aortic rings and blocked their network. After cessation of treatment, the survival time of endostatin plus VEGF-treated tubes was approximately twice as long as that of tubes treated with VEGF alone. Endostatin antibody blocked VEGFinduced endothelial tube formation and disrupted existing tubes. Endostatin immunostaining was localized between endothelium and basement membrane, and in inter-endothelial junctions of new, but not of quiescent, blood vessels. In tumors grown in SCID mice, endostatin immunostaining was strongest when the blood vessels involved were undergoing maturation and was significantly prominent in vessels of the tumor marginal zone, where angiogenesis is highly active. These data indicate a new antiangiogenic action of endostatin in the stabilizing and maturing endothelial tubes of newly formed blood vessels. Thus, strategies accelerating vascular stabilization and maturation could be promising in tumor therapy.|

However, an unexpected dengue outbreak occurred in 2014 in Japan. Given that autochthonous (domestic) dengue cases had not been reported for the past 70 years in Japan, this outbreak was highly unusual and suggests that several environmental factors might have changed in a way that favors vector mosquitoes in the Northeast Asian region. Methods: A Climate Risk Factor (CRF) index, as validated in previous work, was constructed using climate and nonclimate factors. This CRF index was compared to the number of reported dengue cases in Tokyo, Japan where the outbreak was observed in 2014. In order to identify high-risk areas, the CRF index was further estimated at the 5 km by 5 km resolution and mapped for Japan and South Korea. Results: The high-risk areas determined by the CRF index corresponded well to the provinces where a high number of autochthonous cases were reported during the outbreak in Japan. At the provincial-level, high-risk areas for dengue fever were the Eastern part of Tokyo and Kanakawa, the South-Eastern part of Saitama, and the North-Western part of Chiba. While a relatively small number of high-risk areas were identified in South Korea compared with Japan, the highrisk areas in South Korea include popular tourist destinations where international visitors have been increasing. Conclusion: The recent dengue outbreak in Japan may signal that the two adjacent non-dengue-endemic countries are also exposed to the risk of temporal and sporadic behavior of dengue fever. It is critical to understand potential high-risk areas for future outbreaks and to set up appropriate prevention activities at the governmental-level.	Abbreviation CRF: Climate Risk Factors|
662	a9f1c6589817bbdce27b869219799ecc22fa7ed4	Antiviral immunity in crustaceans	Viral diseases of shrimp have caused negative effects on the economy in several countries in Asia, South America and America, where they have numerous shrimp culture industries. The studies on the immunity of shrimp and other crustaceans have mainly focused on general aspects of immunity and as a consequence little is known about the antiviral responses in crustaceans. The aim of this review is to update recent knowledge of innate immunity against viral infections in crustaceans. Several antiviral molecules have been isolated and characterized recently from decapods. Characterization and identification of these molecules might provide a promising strategy for protection and treatment of these viral diseases. In addition dsRNA-induced antiviral immunity is also included.	RNAi is a powerful tool for antiviral responses [173] . Compared to other pharmacological interventions, RNAi is an attractive antiviral therapeutic because it allows interference with the target gene in a highly sequence-specific manner, and therefore essential viral genes can be targeted by design with little or no risk of unexpected off-target effects. Recent studies have demonstrated that the viral disease progression can be blocked by injecting shrimp with dsRNA/siRNA specific to viral genes. This strategy is effective against three unrelated viruses: WSSV, TSV and YHV [104, 105] . The mechanism for this phenomenon is still not clear. In these studies, positive strand RNA virus (e.g. TSV and YHV) and DNA virus (e.g. WSSV) often induce the formation of dsRNAs during their infectious cycles such as genomic replicative intermediates, intramolecular interactions within viral transcripts, and bi-directional transcription [178] . And these dsRNAs might engage the shrimp RNAi pathway, resulting in effective antiviral responses. Thus it will be of interest to investigate whether viral dsRNA accumulates in crustacean cells infected with WSSV, TSV, or YHV. Two components of RNA silencing, Argonaute and Dicer-1, have been characterized from P. monodon [179] [180] [181] . Based on the studies in crustaceans above, plants [149] , fruit flies [150] [151] [152] , mosquitoes [154] , and nematodes [155, 156] , it is likely that RNAi indeed exists as a natural antiviral mechanism in several organisms including crustaceans. These studies and further investigations of genes involved in RNAi in crustaceans should provide the possibility by reverse-genetic approaches to test this hypothesis directly. [107] . Viral dsRNA or extracellular dsRNA enters the RNAi pathway, and/or activates innate antiviral responses directly or indirectly. Signal transduction triggered by dsRNA recognition may regulate transcriptomic expression leading to antiviral reactions. These pathways may function independently as well as interact together to facilitate the antiviral responses.|

In the first study, 96 newborn calves were allocated to four different groups immediately after birth. Calves of group H and of group HN were treated orally with 120 g/kg body weight (BW) of halofuginone lactate daily during the first seven days of life. Calves of group C and of group CN were treated with a same volume of tap water. As an additional measure, the pens of groups HN and CN were disinfected with 3% Neopredisan 135-1 ® (p-chloro-m-cresol), the pens of groups C and H remained non-disinfected. Faeces were examined semi-quantitatively for oocyst excretion using carbolfuchsin-staining and the clinical course was recorded. While disinfection alone (group CN) had no effect on oocyst shedding and diarrhoea, treatment with halofuginone lactate (groups H and HN) reduced oocyst shedding and diarrhoea significantly. Combination of treatment and disinfection (group HN) controlled cryptosporidiosis completely during the first two weeks after birth. However, prevalence of diarrhoea and oocyst shedding was higher in the third week of life in group HN than in any of the other groups. This delayed occurrence of cryptosporidiosis was not seen in study 2 when all calves were similarly protected by treatment and specific disinfection. Oocyst shedding was not observed in peripartal cows either by carbolfuchsin staining, ELISA or PCR.	As previously demonstrated treatment of calves with 120 g halofuginone lactate/kg BW in the first seven days of life is suitable to reduce oocyst excretion and severity and prevalence of diarrhoea due to field outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis. The combination of pro-/metaphylactic treatment within the 1st week of age and specific disinfection of single crates substantially improved control during the most critical period (1st and 2nd week of life). Properly protected young calves may remain more susceptible to cryptosporidia afterwards and therefore it is advisable to also disinfect group pens before previously protected calves are brought in.|
664	8ad36ea61e3245e58a23125a7f12a7fb1adca9ed	The Epidemiology of Alcohol Abuse and Pneumonia Kyle I. Happel	The association between alcohol abuse and pneumonia has been recognized for more than two centuries and represents an enormous health burden worldwide. The fi rst published notation of alcohol as a clinical risk factor for the development of pneumonia is now over 200 years old, and since then there have been over a 1,000 references in the medical literature confi rming these observations. Even in this modern era of medicine pneumonia remains a common infection that affl icts over 450 million persons worldwide annually and causes 7 % of all deaths. When one considers that alcohol is the most commonly abused substance in the world, the enormous excessive burden that alcohol contributes to the morbidity and mortality of pneumonia represents a major public health consideration. In this chapter we review the foundational literature that has chronicled the evolution of our understanding of the association between pneumonia and alcohol abuse over the past century. In addition, we discuss some of the specifi c pathogens that are particularly associated with serious lung infections in individuals with alcohol use disorders. Finally, we consider some of the specifi c guidelines for the treatment and prevention of pneumonia in the setting of alcohol abuse.	Alcohol abuse remains common throughout the world, and the medical literature is incontrovertible in its depiction of alcohol abuse as a risk factor for both an increased incidence and severity of bacterial pneumonia, whether acquired in the community or the hospital setting. The spectrum of pathogens causing pneumonia in the alcohol abuser is somewhat wider and more virulent than in non-abusers, such that the clinical history of alcohol abuse has a direct impact on the clinical care and outcome of such patients. In an era of spiraling global health care costs and regionally scarce health care resources, it would seem prudent to continue or even expand efforts to determine optimal prevention and treatment strategies for bacterial pneumonia and other sequelae of alcohol abuse in these persons. Such measures could have a signifi cant effect not only on the outcome of disease for an individual, but also on the incidence of disease and alcohol's overall economic burden to society. Although not discussed in this chapter, the association between alcohol and other health concerns such as HIV infection, tobacco use, and illicit substance use further supports comprehensive and robust research programs to identify and intervene in those alcohol abusing populations most amenable to response.|
665	157fd9d1607747a37de884d760b57ca87e58e17c	The Longevity-Frailty Hypothesis: Evidence from COVID-19 Death Rates in Europe	COVID-19 death rates vary strikingly across Europe. The death rate in Spain, for example, is greater than the death rate in Germany by more than a factor of ten. Few if any epidemiological indicators distinguish the countries of Europe by such a vast margin. Evidence on age-specific casefatality rates (deaths over observed infections) and age-specific death rates (deaths over population) indicate that COVID-19 disproportionately afflicts the elderly and frail, suggesting that the share of elderly population (≥ 65 years of age) in a country ought to be a strong predictor of the COVID-19 death rate. However, the COVID-19 death rate and the share of elderly population are statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.163, p = 0.399). Share of population ≥ 65 years of age is confounded by mortality selection, as well as other demographic dynamics. By contrast, elderly longevity or life expectancy at 65 more effectively captures population survival and the accumulation of age-related frailty in society. We find a strong statistical relationship between the COVID-19 death rate (r = 0.839, p < .001) and elderly longevity, and a moderately strong relationship between the date of epidemic timing and elderly longevity (r = −0.634, p < .001). These relationships are robust to the inclusion of statistical controls for international tourism inflow and hospital bed capacity. While the countries of Europe vary meaningfully in healthcare system capacity and in the timing and intensity of non-pharmaceutical interventions, the striking variation in COVID-19 death rates across these countries is statistically and intuitively associated with elderly survival and consequent frailty.

Predicted values in Panel B leverage equation (2), again with all other model covariates fixed at their sample means.

666	db067dfd08b929d4f6eba767a3d0444697834715		B A C K G R O U N D Health services are one of the work areas that contain important risks in terms of the occupational health and safety of the laborer. Professionals in various areas of health services encounter biological, chemical, physical, ergonomic, and psychosocial risks, particularly in hospitals.	Industrialization and technological developments have led to occupational injuries and environmental risks, which cause socioeconomic losses not only in Turkey but also in many other countries, including European countries. [98] [99] [100] Although there are precautions taken Occupational Risks of Health Professionals in Turkey against occupational risks in developed European countries, occupational accidents and diseases due to profession have not been prevented for long years. This indicates that it is hard to overcome the risk of occupational disease and accidents. On the other hand, the gradual decrease in occupational accidents and job-related diseases in European countries in the last 10 years demonstrates the importance of applying precautions. In this regard, when we consider the outcomes of Turkey, we should support regulations in the workplace, create incentive systems, ensure the effectiveness of the Occupational Health and Safety Workers' Representation and Occupational Health and Security Committees, and increase training to foster social consciousness instead of waiting for employees and employers to apply these rules themselves. 98 According to the International Labor Organization, it has been reported that there is $1.25 trillion loss each year as a result of OHS problems. 101 In Turkey, the loss of only social security systems has been reported as approximately 4 million Turkish Liras per year. 102 hardware, personnel, and services are still lacking. Therefore, the applications can vary from region to region and institution to institution as well as person to person. 92 In this regard, it may be efficient in Turkey for the government to control services for health professionals and to see that these services are provided independent of the requests of individuals, as in various European countries. 94 The health of health professionals also affects the health of the community. When we consider the regional differences of hospitals in terms of technical equipment, staff, and quality of services in Turkey, which is an emerging economy, it is very important to apply the regulations specified by national laws and procedures across the country, including the public and private health sectors. Additionally, it is crucial to decrease health workers' exposure to occupational risks. 104 OHS is crucial in terms of resource allocation. If a portion of economic resources can be allocated to OHS training and organization, the efficiency and incremental change in production as a result of the application of OHS regulations can accelerate economic growth and development. 105 The importance of OHS precautions has increased because of the understanding that the costs to mitigate the harm of occupational accidents are higher than the costs of preventing occupational accidents. 106 Occupational Risks of Health Professionals in Turkey J u l y eA u g u s t 2 0 1 5 : 5 2 2 -5 2 9|

We collected clinical and biological data, as well as CT scan images and radiology reports from 1,003 coronavirus-infected patients from two French hospitals. Radiologists' manual CT annotations were also available. We first identified 11 clinical variables and 3 types of radiologist-reported features significantly associated with prognosis. Next, focusing on the CT images, we trained deep learning models to automatically segment the scans and reproduce radiologists' annotations. We also built CT image-based deep learning models that predicted future severity better than models based on the radiologists' scan reports. Finally, we showed that including CT scan features alongside the clinical and biological data yielded more accurate predictions than using clinical and biological data alone. These findings show that CT scans provide insightful early predictors of future severity.

Panning is effective for the selection of immunoglobulin genes from naïve and immune libraries. However, it is possible to bypass the phage display system if human peripheral lymphocytes are obtained from seropositive patients with infectious diseases as a source of immunoglobulin genes. Direct screening of bacterial colonies producing Fab fragments by colony blotting using filter membranes is practical for the isolation of human Fab fragments to major antigens of pathogens. An oligoclonal culture can also be used, and is a partial application of Epstein-Barr virus transformation of peripheral lymphocytes. Using these procedures, neutralizing antibody Fab fragments to various antigens can be obtained with a sufficient level of cloning efficacy. Chain shuffling and site-directed mutagenesis are also useful ways to improve the quality of the cloned antibody Fab fragments.	Phage display followed by panning is widely used for preparation of recombinant antibody Fab fragments from large combinatorial immunoglobulin gene libraries from naïve and immune donors. Here, we have shown that bypassing the phage display and panning processes is practical when immunoglobulin genes are derived from seropositive donors. Identification of bacterial colonies using membrane filters and donor plasma is useful for the initial screening of human Fab fragments to major antigenic molecules of pathogens. Preparation of immunoglobulin gene libraries from EB virus-transformed oligoclonal B-LCL can also be used for preparation of human Fab fragments to pathogens and self-antigens. Recently, a new technique bypassing the phage display platform has also been developed. B cells are cultured at near clonal density, culture supernatants are screened, and positives are used to clone authentic antibody genes (Walker et al., 2009) . Thus, improvement of technologies for antibody engineering is still in progress to generate high-affinity human antibodies.|

This new virus, 3 called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensin-4 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe 5 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 6 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein 7 from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. 8 However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, 9 control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed 10 between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association 11 can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a 12 multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new 13 virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data 14 obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between 15 virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in 16 host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that 17 the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, 18 while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our 19 computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible 20 explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 author/funder.

As shown in (b), we found that the first stage in the simulation of 2019-nCoV (red 8 curve) is longer than the simulation of SARS (black curve), while the level of free virus 9 at the end of the first period in 2019-nCoV is relatively higher than the corresponding 10 level of free virus in SARS.

Elucidation of their plasticity and adaptability to disease states triggered early efforts to characterize microglial subsets. Over time, their phenotypes, and later on their homeostatic signature, were revealed, through the use of increasingly advanced transcriptomic techniques. Recently, an increasing number of these ""microglial signatures"" have been reported in various homeostatic and disease contexts. Remarkably, many of these states show similar overlapping microglial gene expression patterns, both in homeostasis and in disease or injury. In this review, we integrate information from these studies, and we propose a unique subset, for which we introduce a core signature, based on our own research and reports from the literature. We describe that this subset is found in development and in normal aging as well as in diverse diseases. We discuss the functions of this subset as well as how it is induced."

Who, in the end, would choose to be 'against preparedness'-especially when one considers the extreme human costs of recent public health emergencies? We are not against it, however. Our argument throughout has been that critique is essential to preparedness and that, to date, critique from a human rights perspective has been in short supply. We have suggested a preliminary agenda to address the human rights gap, focusing in particular on the frames 'risk within rights' and 'rights as risk', and we assigned the name 'human rights preparedness' to the project as a whole. We concluded by turning inwards, emphasising that this project carries risks for human rights itself. Specifically, critiquing preparedness could well involve self-critique as human rights advocacy works towards a more differentiated analysis of how security should be engaged and what it means to do human rights today. Putting that another way, human rights preparedness-and, in particular, engagement with 'rights as risk'-is likely to be human rights without a safety net.|

Case presentation A 56-year-old male with AIS A C4 tetraplegia developed fever during the night, without any prodrome. His general practitioner suspected a urinary tract infection and prescribed him antibiotic therapy. After 2 days of antibiotic therapy the fever still persisted, so the individual was admitted to the local hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. After 2 days he was transferred to our spinal unit. Considering the worsening of the chest X-ray and fever despite 48 h of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, we strongly suspected viral pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 was detected and antiviral therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir, associated with hydroxychloroquine, was promptly started. Fever ceased after 2 days of therapy. Discussion Blood test and chest X-ray findings in this patient were similar to previously published findings regarding COVID-19. One difference between this case and the known clinical course of COVID-19 is that did not develop cough. Another interesting feature of our case is that, despite tetraplegia, the clinical course was not severe. Persons with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic, these results underscore the need for rehabilitation and SCI professionals to have a high index of suspicion for COVID-19 in their inpatient and outpatient clients. Only inpatient with fever hase being tested for COVID-19. All new patients are submitted to SARS-COV-2 Test. Moreover, routine testing of patients who have to participate in therapy in common gym areas may be warranted.

The disruptions caused by COVID-19 allow us to see how the HIV care continuum has been undermined routinely by insufficient concrete and human organizational resources, and by failures to follow up and track provider referrals to HIV services. To demonstrate how structural failures, highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, prevent providers from keeping their clients on the care continuum, we must study how CBOs' organizational supports incorporate client perspectives. COVID-19 exposed the need for research to understand how high volumes of incomplete referrals-i.e. clients not accessing services to which they are referred-waste time allotted for services, increases costs, lengthen waitlists, and jeopardize health outcomes (e.g., retention in care, viral suppression) [6, 28] . Providers' active referral-making (including subsequent coordination and tracking efforts) can facilitate clients' timely access to needed services and reduce waste of organizational resources (e.g., staff hours, social capital) [29] . Despite the growing emphasis on person-centered care [30] [31] [32] [33] , few empirical studies have investigated the implications of person-centered care for organizations offering HIV services [34] [35] [36] . We also need to look at current literature and identify not only gaps but the limitations of past research (e.g. lack of large-scale qualitative evidence and limited involvement of clients and providers). Doing so should help researchers address the limited evidence on referral-making and linkage practices that could help clients access the HIV services to which they are referred (""referral completion""), and, ultimately, end the HIV pandemic within this decade.|"

There are weak coverage, slow tracking systems, low reporting or lack of information on the social-cultural problems in Iran (Salathe et al. 2012 ); thus, a part of the high COVID-19 mortality rate in Iran can be related to the incomplete reports and contradictory description and diagnosis of the disease. Therefore, along with the increasing use of smartphones, expanding social networks among the public, developing online databases, and providing proper analytical methods double the importance of using digital epidemiology in tracking COVID-19.|

Six nanoliposomes differing in cationic lipids were formulated and screened in vitro and in vivo for cellular delivery functions in lung cells/tissues. Although the six nanoliposomes showed similar siRNA delivery efficiency in vitro, they exhibited significant differences in pulmonary cellular delivery functions in vivo. Among the various nanoliposomes, cationic dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine and cholesterol (ECL)-based nanoliposomes showed the highest pulmonary cellular delivery in vivo and the lowest cytotoxicity in vitro. The delivery efficiency of fluorescent siRNA in ECL nanoliposomes was 26.2-fold higher than that of naked siRNA in vivo. Treatment with Mcl1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1)-specific siRNA (siMcl1) using ECL nanolipoplexes reduced target expression in B16F10 cell lines, whereas control, luciferase-specific siGL2 in ECL nanolipoplexes did not. In metastatic lung cancer mouse models induced by B16F10 or Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, intratracheal administration of siMcl1 in ECL nanolipoplexes significantly silenced Mcl1 mRNA and protein levels in lung tissue. Reduced formation of melanoma tumor nodules was observed in the lung. These results demonstrate the utility of ECL nanoliposomes for pulmonary delivery of therapeutic siRNA for the treatment of lung cancers and potentially for other respiratory diseases.	Statistics.

689	eda6aaad8bbaf393e113262e1746cfdc55d6fcf1	Targeting the Vasoprotective Axis of the Renin-Angiotensin System: A Novel Strategic Approach to Pulmonary Hypertensive Therapy	A decade has passed since the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the ACE2-angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7)-Mas counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is considered an endogenous regulator of the vasoconstrictive, proliferative, fibrotic, and proinflammatory effects of the ACE-Ang II-angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) axis. Both animal and clinical studies have emerged to define a role for ACE2 in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There is scientific evidence supporting the concept that ACE2 maintains the RAS balance and plays a protective role in PAH. The activation of pulmonary ACE2 could influence the pathogenesis of PAH and serve as a novel therapeutic target in PAH. Current therapeutic strategies and interventions have limited success, and PAH remains a fatal disease. Thus, more research that establishes the novel therapeutic potential and defines the mechanism of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas counterregulatory axis in PAH is needed.	We need a novel strategic intervention, as PAH is a chronic, fatal disease. Current therapy addresses vasoconstrictor imbalance and endothelial dysfunction, but vasodilator therapy has yet to improve patient survival. Unlike epoprostenol, a prostacyclin analogue and potent vasodilator, most PAH therapies have not improved survival. Therefore, new therapies that target PVR are emerging. Increasing evidence supports the concept of an imbalance in various components of the RAS. Animal and human trials demonstrate that an imbalance that favors the ACE-Ang II-AT 1 R axis actions promotes proliferation, fibrosis, and growth. There is no current consensus for the efficacy of therapeutic PAH strategies such as ACEs or ARBs in human and animal models, yet the benefit of ACE2 overexpression and activation in lung is consistent. In PAH, ACE2 overexpression and activation exerts its effects via the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis, limiting the detrimental actions of the ACE-Ang II-AT 1 R axis and playing a protective role in PH. The exact mechanism of benefit remains elusive, but the benefit in both prevention and reversal studies in animal models is clear. Thus, activation of ACE2 is a novel and effective strategy for PAH that must be considered. Targeting the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis prevents and reverses pulmonary vascular pathology of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

First, this study reinforces the concept that the GDS-S is a screening rather than a diagnostic test. Important patient factors can affect the utility of the GDS-S in some patient populations, but the final diagnosis of depression remains a clinical judgment. In addition, this study has implications for proposed shortened versions of the GDS-S. For example, two questions of the shortened 5-Item Geriatric Depression Scale 4 were not understood by more than 10% our study patients. It is likely that this study may underestimate the extent of this problem, because some persons who did not understand the questions may have simply given an answer rather than admit their confusion. The ideal screening test for depression in older African Americans remains to be clearly demonstrated, and this study points out some important concerns regarding use of the GDS-S if it is to be used clinically for depression screening in this patient popula-tion. Whether other screening tools for depression share this same problem remains to be demonstrated.|

Successful activation of PRRs is, therefore, critical to controlling infections and driving pathogen-specific adaptive immunity, but overactivity of PRRs causes systemic inflammation, which is detrimental to the host. Here we review the PRR literature as it relates to horses and speculate on the role PRRs may play in sepsis and endotoxaemia.	CEB's work on equine Toll-like receptors and endotoxaemia is funded by the Horse Betting Levy Board. |

Compared to Internet shopping, the consumer behavior of TV shopping is nonetheless neglected. This paper sheds light on the consumer behavior of TV travel product shopping and specifically investigates the relationships between perceived value, satisfaction, and loyalty of TV shoppers. The findings reveal that in general only the effect of perceived value, but not satisfaction, on loyalty is supported. Furthermore, the consumer product involvement shows its moderating effects on the value-satisfaction-loyalty model.	Travel product purchasing on TV-shopping channels includes a wide range of products such as accommodations, flight tickets, tour packages, car rentals, etc. However, the data used in this study are limited to TV-shopping buyers of accommodation products in Taiwan. Although the model of this study offers some insights of TV-shopping behaviors, more future research is required to generalize the consumer behaviors of TV travel product shopping thoroughly. Additionally, several limitations of the study are noted. Nonprobability sample with self-report data used by the study is a limitation. Probability sampling in association with demographic information is suggested for further investigation. The issue of impulse purchasing behavior made by other studies on TV-shopping behaviors is also suggested to be adopted as another moderator to examine its influences on the model in future research. |

Here, we demonstrate that VIGOR has been extended to accurately predict protein coding genes and identify the complex gene features for additional 12 different viruses. If reference protein sequences of a new virus are available and the genome structure and complex gene features of the new virus are well understood, virus species-specific modules can be developed to identify the complex gene features (if they exist) in the virus genomes. With the drop of sequencing cost and the increase of sequencing productivity, tremendous number of different virus species from both clinical and environmental samples will be sequenced. The accuracy and efficiency of gene prediction will be critical to interpret newly sequenced viral genomes and to understand these viruses. VIGOR can be extended to annotate the genomes of new viruses by incorporating new reference sequences into the protein database and developing the virus species-specific modules.|

It has been demonstrated that rotaviruses can establish persistent infections in cell culture [63] , but the control mechanisms responsible for chronic infections in animals and/or cell lines have yet to be unraveled. Lastly, the hosts and reservoirs of these viruses remain to be established. Unfortunately, possible cross-species infections and the lack of reliable sensitive methods to detect rotavirus strain differences do not make these goals easily attainable. Finally, the possible role of these viral agents in the establishment and maintenance of chronic diarrhea1 disease warrants further investigation, both with respect to chronic diarrhea of childhood and the relationship to inflammatory bowel disease. Although prevention of gastroenteritis by vaccination is suggested in many publications, the primitive state of our knowledge of gastroenteritis viruses makes such discussions truly academic at the present time.|

We noted gene transfer efficiencies similar to that observed for human airway epithelia (HAE). Interestingly, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based vectors transduced immortalized pig cells as well as pig primary cells more efficiently than HIV-1-based vectors. PAE express TRIM5α, a well-characterized species-specific lentiviral restriction factor. We contrasted the restrictive properties of porcine TRIM5α against FIV-and HIV-based vectors using gain and loss of function approaches. We observed no effect on HIV-1 or FIV conferred transgene expression in response to porcine TRIM5α overexpression or knockdown. To evaluate the ability of GP64-FIV to transduce porcine airways in vivo, we delivered vector expressing mCherry to the tracheal lobe of the lung and the ethmoid sinus of 4-week-old pigs. One week later, epithelial cells expressing mCherry were readily detected. Our findings indicate that pseudotyped FIV vectors confer similar tropisms in porcine epithelia as observed in human HAE and provide further support for the selection of GP64 as an appropriate envelope pseudotype for future preclinical gene therapy studies in the porcine model of cystic fibrosis (CF).

Limited data exist on the epidemiology of ICU-acquired infections in China. This retrospective study was carried out to determine the current status of nosocomial infection in China.	In conclusion, there was a high and relatively stable rate of nosocomial infections in the ICU of a tertiary hospital in China through year 2003-2007, with some differences in the distribution of the infection sites, and pathogen and antibiotic susceptibility profiles from those reported in the Western countries. The Guidelines for Surveillance and Prevention of Nosocomial Infections must be implemented national wide in order to reduce the rate.|

Plasmids from bla NDM -positive isolates were transformed into a carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii (CS-AB) isolate to assess the role of plasmid transfer in mediating carbapenem resistance. Imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem MIC90 values against bla NDM -positive isolates were 128, > 256, and 256 µg/mL, respectively. Plasmid isolation and polymerase chain reaction revealed that bla NDM was plasmid mediated. The plasmids were electroporated into the cells of a CS-AB isolate at an efficiency of 1.3 × 10 -8 to 2.6 × 10 -7 , transforming them to bla NDM -positive carbapenemresistant cells with an imipenem MIC increase of 256-fold. In addition to carbapenem resistance, the bla NDM -positive isolates also exhibited higher levels of cephalosporins, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and colistin resistance than the bla NDM -negative isolates. Acquisition of bla NDM -carrying plasmids dramatically increased imipenem resistance among A. baumannii isolates. Intriguingly, bla NDM -positive isolates also showed a high degree of resistance to antibiotics of different classes. The potential co-existence of different resistance determinants on A. baumannii plasmids and their possible transfer owing to the natural competence of the pathogen are especially alarming. More effective infection control and antibiotic stewardship programs are needed to curb the spread and treat such infections in both hospital and community settings.	bla NDM was plasmid mediated in the tested CR-AB isolates from Alexandria, Egypt. The increased resistance of these isolates to other antibiotic classes coupled with the natural competence of A. baumannii which facilitates plasmid transfer to CS-AB isolates point to potential loss of the effectiveness of invaluable antimicrobial agents. This warrants further investigation of the genetic context of bla NDM on the plasmids using genomic techniques, towards the design of effective antibiotic stewardship and infection control policies in Egyptian hospitals and the community.|
701	0fd7f743bb31fcf944f2cd0ba4f6969fc61532d6	Characterization of Bovine Parainfluenza Virus Type 3	Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV -3) has a buoyant density of 1.197.	Buoyant Density of PIV -3 PIV -3 labeled with 3H-leucine was concentrated from culture fluids by polyethylenglycol precipitation, as described in Materials and Methods, and sedimented through a linear sucrose density gradient (20 to 55% w/v in NTE buffer) at 25,000 rpm for 16 hr at 4 C in a Spinco SW 27 -1 rotor. As presented in Fig. 1, a sharp peak of infectivity coincided with the peak of hemagglutinating activity and that of TCA-insoluble radioactivity, being located at the density of 1.197 which was very similar to the value reported by Tsai and Thomson (32 ) . An electron microscopic study of the peak revealed roughly spherical virus particles carrying spikes on the surface, sharing common features with other viruses of the paramyxovirus group (Fig.  2) and resembling closely the electron micrographs of PIV -3 presented by Waterson et al (33 ) . The size of particles ranged from 80 nm to 300 nm in diameter with a mean value of 130 to 140 nm. The virus in the peak formed a band at the top of the 47% sucrose layer in the discontinuous sucrose density gradient used for virus purification. Occasionally PIV -3 formed another minor band between the 47% and 52% sucrose layers (lower band), depending on each virus preparation. The lower band and 3H-glucosamine in another gel. These figures show that PIV-3 has at least 5 proteins, of which 2 are glycoprotein. We designated the PIV-3 proteins as P1, P2, P3, glycoproteini (GP1), and GP2. Analysis of Triton X-100-treated samples electrophoresed in other slots of the gel identical to that of Fig. 6a revealed that the radioactivity of 3H-glucosamine of GP1 remained entirely in Triton-sup (see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 6b) and did not sediment with Triton-ppt (Fig. 6c) , whereas Triton-ppt showed a single sharp peak of 14C-radioactivity of P2 (Fig. 6c) . These facts suggested that GP1 was an envelope-associated glycoprotein and P2 nucleocapsid protein (22 ) . The insufficient recovery of GP2, P1, and P3 after Triton X-100 treatment could not be explained but was supposed to be due to loss of these proteins dur- ing repeated washing with solvents. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of gels confirmed that GP1 and GP2 were glycoproteins whereas Pi, P2, and P3 were not (not shown). From the results, the molecular weights of PIV-3 structural proteins were calculated, comparing their migration rates with those of Sendai virus proteins of known molecular weights (8) . Thus, P1, P2, P3, GP1, and GP2 of PIV-3 were estimated to be 79,000, 68,000, 35,000, 69,000, and 55,000 daltons, respectively. |

Several enteropathogens are associated with diarrhea in young calves, with Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection being the most common type of colibacillosis. The rise of antibiotic resistance in a number of medically important bacterial pathogens has revived interest in the use of bacteriophages as anti-bacterial therapeutic agents. Here we describe the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study designed to evaluate the effect of an oral bacteriophage cocktail on fecal E. coli colony-forming units (CFU). Ten calves were enrolled in the study to either the bacteriophage group or the placebo group for 22 feedings. Calves in the bacteriophage treatment group (n= 6) received a total of 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFU) (volume = 5 ml) of each of four bacteriophages while the placebo group (n = 4) received only phosphate-buffered saline (5 ml). Fresh fecal samples and blood samples were collected daily from each calf and analyzed for bacterial count and presence of bacteriophage. E. coli-infecting phages were recovered from all phage-treated calves at concentrations of 10² to 10³ PFU per gram of rectal contents, but none was detected in serum. Phage treatment caused a reduction in fecal E. coli when compared to the control group: the mean log CFU for the placebo-treated group was 9.25 (SE = 0.42) versus 9.11 (SE = 0.34) for the phage-treated group, but the difference was not statistically significant.

703	bdfce208ef62424bc68fdb610364dab6416365e1	Physiological Level Production of Antigen-Specific Human Immunoglobulin in Cloned Transchromosomic Cattle	Therapeutic human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs) derived from pooled plasma from human donors are Food and Drug Administration approved biologics used in the treatment of a variety of human diseases. Powered by the natural diversity of immune response, hpAbs are effective in treating diseases caused by complex or quickly-evolving antigens such as viruses. We previously showed that transchromosomic (Tc) cattle carrying a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH) and kappachain (hIGK) germline loci (named as κHAC) are capable of producing functional hpAbs when both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chains, bIGHM and bIGHML1, are homozygously inactivated (double knockouts or DKO). However, B lymphocyte development in these Tc cattle is compromised, and the overall production of hpAbs is low. Here, we report the construction of an improved HAC, designated as cKSL-HACΔ, by incorporating all of the human immunoglobulin germline loci into the HAC. Furthermore, for avoiding the possible human-bovine interspecies incompatibility between the human immunoglobulin mu chain protein (hIgM) and bovine transmembrane α and β immunoglobulins (bIgα and bIgβ) in the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex, we partially replaced (bovinized) the hIgM constant domain with the counterpart of bovine IgM (bIgM) that is involved in the interaction between bIgM and bIgα/Igβ; human IgM bovinization would also improve the functionality of hIgM in supporting B cell activation and proliferation. We also report the successful production of DKO Tc cattle carrying the cKSL-HACΔ (cKSL-HACΔ/ DKO), the dramatic improvement of B cell development in these cattle and the high level production of hpAbs (as measured for the human IgG isotype) in the plasma. We further demonstrate that, upon immunization by tumor immunogens, high titer tumor immunogen-specific human IgG (hIgG) can be produced from such Tc cattle.	(XLSX)|

In December 2010, Alberta Health Services (AHS) implemented a province-wide hospital overcapacity protocol (OCP) structured upon the Viccellio model. in patient-hours (pt-hrs). Throughput is reported as time from ED arrival to physician assessment and percent left without being seen (LWBS). Continuous variables were compared with the Student's t-test. Results: The volume of ED patients across all sites increased by 6.3% from the pre phase to the post phase (579071 vs. 615787; p < 0.001) while admission rates remained constant (12.9% vs. 13.1%; p = NS). ED LOS for admitted patients decreased from 17.2 hours to 11.6 hours (p < 0.001); the load of admitted patients at 10 am declined from 11.3 pt-hrs to 6.1 (p < 0.001). Average time from ED arrival to physician assessment decreased in the post phase (113.2 vs. 99.3 minutes; p < 0.001) as did % LWBS (4.0% vs 3.8%; p < 0.001). All OCP effects remained constant over time; however, there were regional disparities in its impact. Conclusion: Policy-driven changes in ED and hospital operations were associated with significant improvements in both throughput and output metrics, despite increased input. Which components of the OCP program had the greatest impact are uncertain, as are explanations for the differential regional impact.	Results: Data were collected on 171 patients over a 30month period from May 2009 to Nov 2011. Patients excluded from NPV analysis consisted of: initial APAP level greater than 100 mcg/ml (31), negligible APAP level on both the initial and confirmatory APAP level (31), initial APAP level drawn less than one hour after ingestion (15), or an unknown time of ingestion (1).

Development of molecular technologies allowed a better understanding of bronchiolitis aetiology. Results from cohort studies evaluating the association between single, multiple viral infections and clinical outcomes are conflicting. Data on viral bronchiolitis in children were found to be limited in Qatar. This study aimed to determine frequency and seasonal trends of viral pathogens causing acute bronchiolitis, and to explore association between viral pathogens, disease severity and length of stay (LOS). Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study, including children admitted in 2010 and 2011 with acute bronchiolitis. Presenting history, physical examination and respiratory viral co-infections as detected by molecular assays were analysed. Results: At least one virus was detected in 315/369 (85.4%) of included children with single and multiple viruses in 67 and 33% of cases respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most detected virus, accounting for 51. 2% followed by rhinovirus (RV) in 25.5% of cases. Fall and summer admissions were associated with longer LOS. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, retraction (OR 3.96; 95% CI 1.64,9.59) and age group 1-3 months (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.06,9.05) were associated with longer LOS. Crepitation (OR 9.15; 95% CI 1.58,53.13), retraction (OR 4.10; 95% CI 1.05,16.12) and respiratory rate (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.28,1.66) were associated with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. Identifying the viral agent did not influence disease severity or LOS.	Additional file 1: Table S1 . Bronchiolitis severity score; Table S2 .

As a respiratory disease, influenza A virus (IAV) infection can lead to hepatitis, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of hepatitis by establishing a model for infected mice for three different subtypes of respiratory IAVs (H1N1, H5N1, and H7N2). Histological analysis was performed, and results showed increase serum aminotransferase (ALT and AST) levels and evident liver injury on days 3 and 7, especially on day 5 post infection. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) results indicated a wide distribution of IAV's positive signals in the liver of infected mice. Real-time PCR results further revealed a similar viral titer to IHC that presented a remarkedly positive correlation with histology injury. All these data showed that the mouse model suitably contributed valuable information about the mechanism underlying the occurrence of hepatitis induced by respiratory influenza virus.	In this study, our data demonstrated that pathological injury appeared on day 3 and aggravated to a peak on day 5, and then gradually decreased on day 7. This finding can be regarded as a short stage compared with virus induced respiratory damage during the entire infection period. Our data were similar to those of a previous research wherein respiratory infection induced mild liver damage and was selflimiting. However, the underlying mechanism needs further exploration. In summary, our present data suggested that respiratory influenza A virus infection induced liver injury and likely contributed to the viral replication in the liver. This work contributes to the research on the interaction between IAV and host and further explains the complex pathogenesis of influenza virus infection.|

With an immune-mediated disease entity, host genetic variant was suggested to influence the occurrence of FIP. This study aimed at evaluating cytokine-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), receptor-associated SNPs, i.e., C-type lectin DC-SIGN (CD209), and the five FIP-associated SNPs identified from Birman cats of USA and Denmark origins and their associations with the outcome of FCoV infection in 71 FIP cats and 93 FCoV infected non-FIP cats in a genetically more diverse cat populations. A promoter variant, fTNFA -421 T, was found to be a disease-resistance allele. One SNP was identified in the extracellular domain (ECD) of fCD209 at position +1900, a G to A substitution, and the A allele was associated with FIP susceptibility. Three SNPs located in the introns of fCD209, at positions +2276, +2392, and +2713, were identified to be associated with the outcome of FCoV infection, with statistical relevance. In contrast, among the five Birman FIP cat-associated SNPs, no genotype or allele showed significant differences between our FIP and non-FIP groups. As disease resistance is multifactorial and several other host genes could involve in the development of FIP, the five genetic traits identified in this study should facilitate in the future breeding of the disease-resistant animal to reduce the occurrence of cats succumbing to FIP.

Effective surveillance and response remain our best protection against these deadly threats. Unfortunately, surveillance remains poor and rudimentary in the most vulnerable countries where outbreaks are most likely. Strengthening the health and surveillance systems of poor developing countries is critically needed in a globalized world because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries.

715	ed0b56ed82cde1bede09cf2d8f09049ad2c133b7	COVID-19 Disease Dynamics in Germany: First Models and Parameter Identification	Since the end of 2019 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, is reported from China and later other parts of the world. Since January 21, WHO reports daily data on confirmed cases and deaths from both China and other countries [1]. The Johns Hopkins University [5] collects those data from various sources worldwide on a daily basis. For Germany, the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) also issues daily reports on the current number of infections and infection related fatal cases [2]. However, due to delays in the data collection, the data from RKI always lags behind those reported by Johns Hopkins. In this work we present an extended SEIR-model to describe the disease dynamics in Germany. The parameter values are identified by matching the model output to the officially reported cases. An additional parameter to capture the influence of unidentified cases is also included in the model.	We present three SIR-based models for describing the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Germany. Besides a standard SEIR-model, we consider an extension taking into account the effect of social distancing by a time-dependent reduction of the transmission rate. The third model introduces a delay-term to accurately describe the deaths depending on infected cases that occurred several days in the past. Comparing the simulation results to the data published by Johns Hopkins University allows an estimation of the unknown model parameters. Best results are obtained using the delay equation model. In this setting, we find a detection rate of about 20% and a lethality of about 4%. The social distancing measures were leading to an effective reduction of the transmission rate by a factor 4. That is, after the introduction of the measures roughly just 25% of the social contact compared to the initial period were leading to infections.|
716	eff71bd40689c4abaa18423d563e1962a91d2758	Auricular chondritis in a cat	A four-year-old male neutered domestic shorthaired cat developed bilateral thickening of the pinnae, with slight curling, intense erythema and pain. No ear canal disease was present. The cat was negative for feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukaemia virus and feline coronavirus. Biopsy of the ear lesion revealed auricular chondritis. In humans, histologlcally similar lesions may Involve the pinnae, nose, trachea, joints, eyes and heart, and the disease Is termed relapsing polychondritis. The cat reported had a history of corneal damage, resulting in corneal vascularlsation and opacity, eyelid distortion, necessitating an entroplon operation, and radiological evidence of mild cardiac enlargement. The ear disease responded rapidly to treatment with prednisolone and, apart from slight thickening and curling of the pinnae, the cat remained normal and pain-free. After two years, the prednisolone was withdrawn, and there was no recurrence of the condition in a follow-up period of 14 months.	Cases of floppy pinnae in cats (Pearson 1998 , Rest 1998 ) may have the same aetiology as reported here. It is clear that such cases justify as full an investigation as possible, including cardiac and ocular assessment, and detailed histopathological examination, in order to assist with diagnosis and understanding of this condition.|
717	389d0e7bcfe7b090fc97ac3f5ed8406558401945	Detection and Sequence Characterization of the 3 -End of Coronavirus Genomes Harboring the Highly Conserved RNA Motif s2m	A remarkably conserved 43-nucleotide-long motif present at the 3 -end of the genomes of several members of the polyadenylated RNA virus families Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, and Picornaviridae can be used for the detection and sequence characterization of the viruses harboring it. The procedure makes use of a primer located in the most conserved core of s2m toward a generic anchored oligo(dT) primer in a semispecific PCR. This strategy allows the sequencing of some 50-100 nucleotides from the 3 -end of the virus genome, representing sufficient sequence information for initiation of further genomic characterization in a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5 -RACE) and primer walking strategy.	1. In addition to coronaviruses, this procedure has been successfully applied to amplify and sequence novel astrovirus and picornavirus genomes, and potentially all polyadenylated viral genomes harboring s2m can be identified and characterized with this procedure. However, when used on biological samples that do not contain s2m-harboring viruses, nonspecific amplification of host cell ribosomal RNA is obtained on some occasions. 2. We have generally used 1 l anchored oligo(dT) 18 (25 M) in the RT, but 1 l Invitrogens anchored oligo(dT) 20 (2.5 g/l, corresponding to ca. 350 M), or Invitrogens standard oligo(dT) 20 (50 M), has also been used successfully as a reverse primer. 3. The obtained PCR products often give a smear on visualization on agarose gel, owing to serial mispriming of the anchored oligo(dT) primer on the 3 poly(A) tail, leading to long-range accumulation of As in the PCR products that can be observed upon sequencing. However, if amplification is successful, all PCR products, regardless of the number of terminal As, have the same start at s2m, as the s2m-core primer is highly specific, and the PCR product smear can be sequenced using s2m-core or s2m-coreseq primer. 4. As several of the viruses harboring s2m do terminate the genome with GC(A)n, AV12 (2.5 M) can often be used for sequencing the opposite strand. If low signal intensity is obtained for the sequences, the following modifications can be made in the cycle sequencing program: lowering the annealing temperature to 50 • C and/or adding 5-10 cycles in the cycle sequencing reaction. 5. Once a specific reverse primer can be designed as described in Section 3.2, an alternative strategy to 5 -RACE/primer walking is to amplify directly a long PCR product using upstream primers in conserved family-specific motifs, e.g., in the polymerase gene. This will be achieved more easily with viruses that have small genomes, such as astrovirus and picornavirus, especially when the polymerase is encoded toward the 3 -end of the genome, rather than with coronaviruses that have a large genome. In our laboratory, we were able to get sequence information by using the sense 2Bm primer designed by Stephensen et al. in 1999 (7) toward the coronavirus specific primer at the 3 -end of the coronavirus genome. However, the PCR product yield was low, and only short sequence stretches could be obtained in this way. 6. The RT in the 5 -RACE procedure is laborious, as no mix containing all the reagents is prepared in advance, but, rather, primer and enzymes are added individually to each sample. In addition, the 5 -RACE procedure described in the Invitrogen handbook suggests that the RNase treatment of the sample be performed on freshly synthesized cDNA, that has not been frozen. This is why the initial RT step described in Section 3.1, performed in order to check novel coronavirus genomes for the presence of s2m, makes use of a simpler RT protocol. 7. An increased amount of the Superscript III reverse transcriptase (400 U per reaction instead of the normally 200 U) is used for long-range cDNA synthesis in the 5 -RACE strategy. In addition, this enzyme allows the reaction to be performed at a temperature as high as 55 • C, which minimizes secondary structures in RNA and is RNase H negative, which increases the yield of full-length cDNAs. 8. It is important to degrade the template RNA from the newly synthesized cDNA, to avoid hybrid renaturation prior to the tailing step. The RNase mix consists of both RNase H to hydrolyze RNA bound to cDNA, and RNase T1 to hydrolyze free RNA molecules. 9. The 5 -RACE PCR is semispecific, using an anchor primer as sense primer, which amplifies the poly(C)-tailed template, and a newly designed coronavirusspecific reverse primer. Even if care has been taken throughout the whole procedure to avoid synthesis of short cDNAs from template RNA, there might be some shorter cDNA molecules that will be more easily amplified in PCRs. It is therefore important to use a PCR enzyme with a proofreading activity, in order to get PCR products from the longer cDNA molecules as well. 10. The long elongation step is chosen to allow amplification of longer cDNAs. 11. As cDNA molecules of different lengths are generated during RT, the 5 -RACE PCR products will be of different lengths, so the 5 -RACE abridged anchor primer cannot be used in cycle sequencing. As all the 5 -RACE PCR products have aligned 3 -ends, the coronavirus-specific 5 -RACE reverse PCR primer or, preferably for increased specificity, a primer slightly upstream of this PCR primer is used in cycle sequencing. 12. Using this procedure, one should obtain at least 500 nucleotides, which would allow the design of new primers both in sense direction for sequence verification and reverse direction for acquisition of new sequence data toward the 5 -end of the genome in a primer walking strategy. The new primers can be used directly in step 5 of the 5 -RACE procedure, if all the steps have been optimized for longrange cDNA synthesis. However, usually no more than 2000-3000 nucleotides are efficiently sequenced from the initial 5 -RACE-RT, and the whole 5 -RACE procedure has to be repeated with a primer for cDNA synthesis as upstream as possible.|
718	04b8265f570ba481ebe1c7d086feb03cbace90a5	Survival of surrogate coronaviruses in water	Water Survival Fecal a b s t r a c t The emergence of a previously unknown coronavirus infection, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), demonstrated that fecally contaminated liquid droplets are a potential vehicle for the spread of a respiratory virus to large numbers of people. To assess potential risks from this pathway, there is a need for surrogates for SARS coronavirus to provide representative data on viral survival in contaminated water. This study evaluated survival of two surrogate coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis (MHV). These viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks. At 25 C, time required for 99% reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days for TGEV and 17 days for MHV. In pasteurized settled sewage, times for 99% reduction were 9 days for TGEV and 7 days for MHV. At 4 C, there was <1 log 10 infectivity decrease for both viruses after four weeks. Coronaviruses can remain infectious for long periods in water and pasteurized settled sewage, suggesting contaminated water is a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated. (M.D. Sobsey).	The coronaviruses TGEV and MHV survived and remained infectious for long periods in different water types, including reagent-grade water, surface water, and pasteurized settled sewage. Both viruses survived and remained infectious at both low (4 C) and ambient (25 C) temperatures. In all water types tested (reagent-grade water, lake water and settled sewage), the titer of infectious virus declined more rapidly at 25 C than at 4 C. Water type, incubation time, and temperature were significant predictors of log 10 viral reduction kinetics. The persistence of coronaviruses in water observed in this study suggests that if SARS-CoV should reemerge in human populations, water contaminated with these viruses may continue to pose an exposure risk even after infected individuals are no longer present.|

Data has been updated in the Demographic characteristics section.	There has been little international policy debate surrounding the use of influenza vaccination in the prevention of ischaemic cardiac disease morbidity in people less than 65 years of age. The current recommendations are for selective vaccination of people with known risk factors often at personal expense. However, this does not achieve adequate vaccination rates. 27 Other studies which have looked at influenza and AMI in people aged <65 years have shown mixed results, but even a small reduction in AMI by prevention of influenza may have population health benefit. 32 33 The role of an expanded vaccination programme for adults over 50 years of age, which would capture a significant proportion of people at risk of AMI, should be explored by further research. At the least, clinicians *Serological evidence of influenza is either a fourfold rise in titre between baseline and convalescent sera or a baseline titre of ≥64 in an unvaccinated individual. Vaccination status was validated by GP records. †Also had a baseline antibody titre for influenza A ≥64 (only counted once) (1×2009 case and 1×2010 case). ‡Also had a >fourfold rise in influenza A antibody titre (counted once in total). GP, general practitioner; NAT, nucleic acid testing. should be aware of influenza and infection as an underlying and poorly diagnosed precipitant or comorbidity in hospitalised patients and of the preventive benefit of influenza vaccine for patients at risk for AMI.|

It is a demyelinating disease affecting mainly the white matter of the cerebellum and areas adjacent to the fourth ventricle; the enzymes of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) group, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9 have a key role in the myelin basic protein fragmentation and in demyelination, as well as in leukocyte traffic into the nervous milieu. To evaluate the involvement of MMPs during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis, we measured the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by zymography in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the cerebellum of 14 dogs naturally infected with CDV and 10 uninfected dogs. The infected dogs presented high levels of pro-MMP-2 in the CSF and elevated levels of pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 in the cerebellar tissue. Active MMP-2 was detected in the CSF of some infected dogs. As active MMP-2 and MMP-9 are required for cellular migration across the blood-brain barrier and any interference between MMPs and their inhibitors may result in an amplification of demyelination, this study gives additional support to the involvement of MMPs during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis and suggests that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may take part in the brain inflammatory changes of this disease.	The characterization of separate roles for individual MMPs is complicated by the wide variation of expression patterns, kinetics, substrate, and cell specificity in different inflammatory settings (Savarin et al., 2011) . By zymography, there was no way of detecting a constant profile of MMPs in the CSF and the cerebellar tissue of the dogs and establishing a secure biomarker for the subacute inflammatory phase of the CDV infection; however, pro-MMP-2 was present in most of the CSF samples and pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 were increased in the cerebellum. The MMPs/TIMPs imbalance may contribute to the complex mechanisms enrolled in distemper leukoencephalitis and therapies based on metalloproteinase inhibitors for dogs may be an additional aid to help in the recovery or stop the progression of the lesions in animals in the acute phase of disease.|

Hofmann 2 1 Drug Regulatory Affairs, Fachgruppe Pharmazie, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, Bonn, Deutschland, 2 Activaero GmbH, Gemünden/Wohra, Deutschland Zystische Fibrose (CF) und Bronchiektasien führen über rezidivierende Exazerbationen (insb. P. aeruginosa) zu einer progredienten Lungenschädigung, die insbesondere bei Patienten mit CF eine häufige Ursache des terminalen Organversagens darstellt. In der Vergangenheit wurde durch eine verbesserte Therapie die Prognose der CF zwar wesentlich verbessert, doch weisen die betroffenen Patienten auch weiterhin eine deutlich verminderte Lebenserwartung auf. Neben der systemischen Gabe von Antibiotika vor allem bei Exazerbationen hat sich auch deren lokale Verabreichung durch Inhalation etabliert. Eine Antibiotikainhalation ermöglicht hohe Atemwegskonzentrationen ohne die bei systemischer Therapie zu erwartenden toxischen Reaktionen. Voraussetzung einer erfolgreichen Therapie ist die adäquate Verabreichung durch Inhalationssysteme, die eine gute Atemwegsdeposition erlauben, und eine Eignung der Substanz zur inhalativen Verabreichung. Ziel der Arbeit war die Analyse von Studien zur Antibiotikainhalation. Basierend auf PUBMED wurden bisherige Studien zur Antibiotikainhalation fokussierend auf neuere Verfahren und CF-Patienten ausgewertet. Erste kontrollierte Studien erfolgten vor etwa 20 Jahren in den USA und wurden meist mit zur oralen oder intravenösen Gabe zugelassenen Antibiotika durchgeführt. Am häufigsten fanden sich Studien mit Tobramycinlösungen verschiedener Hersteller, die mit verschiedenen Verneblern verabreicht wurden. Daher variieren einzusetzende Substanzdosen und -volumina sowie Anzahl täglicher Inhalationen erheblich. Eine Neuentwicklung stellt die bereits auf dem Markt befindliche Tobramycin-Pulverinhalation dar. Veröffentlichungen zu Colistin umfassen meist die Flüssigkeitsverneblung. Ein Pulverinhalationsverfahren für Colistin wurde jüngst zugelassen. Ebenfalls bereits zugelassen und mit verschiedenen Verneblern untersucht ist die Inhalation von Aztreonam als Flüssigkeit. In den Entwicklungsphasen 2 und 3 befinden sich Levofloxazin (Flüssigkeit), Fosfomycin/Tobramycin (Flüssigkeit), Amikacin (Liposomen in Flüssigkeit) und Ciprofloxacin (Liposomen in Flüssigkeit, Pulveraerosol). Darüber hinaus wurden noch weitere Substanzen wie z. B. Galliumnitratcitrat, Pseudomonasantikörper, Vancomycin, Lactoferrin und antimikrobielle Peptide untersucht, die sich meist in früheren Entwicklungsstadien befinden. Verwendet werden zunehmend Fixkombinationen aus Pharmakon und Verneblersystem. Einzelne Methoden basieren auf der Verabreichung von Pulveraerosolen mit entsprechenden Devices. Neuere Methoden weisen gegenüber älteren kürzere Inhalationszeiten und oft geringere Dosierungen auf, was bei guter Verträglichkeit und Wirksamkeit die Anwendbarkeit durch Verbesserung der Compliance und Verminderung der Kosten verbessert. Neue Substanzen und Verabreichungsmethoden könnten daher zur weiteren Prognoseverbesserung bei Patienten mit CF und Bronchiektasien beitragen. [4] . Zu beobachten ist das Outsourcing von Ergotherapie und das Kappen von akademischen Berufsgruppen (Neuropsychologie). Problemstellung: Die Weiterentwicklung und der Erhalt des geriatrischen Teams im Sinne der Organisationsentwicklung[5] sind unter dem enormen Kostendruck der vergangenen 10 Jahre ins Stocken geraten. Dabei ist der Bedarf an systematischer Entwicklung des Teams erheblich,wenn man die Dimensionen (Einflussvariablen) einer erfolgreichen Teamarbeit betrachtet: Teambesetzung, Teamführung, Teamdesign, Teamarbeit, Leistung des Teams Mit der Operationalisierung der geriatrischen OPS sind die Minimallevel der Leistungserbringung berechenbar geworden ohne die Umsetzbarkeit quantitativ abzubilden. Fragestellung:Welche Schlussfolgerung sind im Hinblick auf die geriatrischen OPS aus den bekannten Personal-anhaltszahlen geriatrischer Abteilungen auf die Betriebsführung aus Sicht der Organisations-entwicklung zu ziehen? Ergebnisse:Hierzu werden die Teamstärken von 5 geriatrischen Kliniken und deren Verknüpfung zur Organisationsentwicklung dargestellt. Schlussfolgerung: Obwohl die von Campbell&Cole entwickelte Teambeschreibung bereits älter ist, kann nicht oft genug betont werden, dass der Austausch von Informationen, die professionelle Zuordnung von Verantwortlichkeiten im Team und das Formulieren von Behandlungszielen nur ein Minimal-Niveau einer Teamentwicklung1 darstellen. Für den Erhalt des ""geriatrischen Teams"" bzw dessen Arbeitsergebnisses sind erforderlich: adäquate Anzahl der Mitarbeiter, die Förderung der sozialen &der Methodenkompetenz,räumliche Nähe der Teammitglieder,Heterogenität im Wissen & Homogenität im Workflow erforderlich. Ergebnissauswahl. Im Durchschnitt handelte es sich um 81 Jahre alte Patienten, deren 12 Diagnosen mit 9 Arzneimitteln behandelt wurden. Nach Empfehlung der Ll wird für Pat.<70 Jahren ohne Komorbidität standardmäßig eine Dopaminagonisten-Monoth., bei >70-jährigen Pat. oder multimorbiden Pat. jeder Altersgruppe eine Levodopa-Monoth. (immer + Decarboxylase-Hemmer) empfohlen. Bei milder Symptomatik können beide Patientengruppen im Rahmen einer Amantadinoder MAO-B-Hemmer-Monoth. eingestellt werden. 12,8% der stat. Pat. wurden Ll-gerecht, 27,4% nicht Ll-gerecht therapiert. In 59,8% der Fälle konnte die Therapie nicht beurteilt werden. Schlussfolgerung. Ll sind elementare Bestandteile der evidenzbasierten Arzneimitteltherapie, die Umsetzung kann sich jedoch gerade für Geriater schwierig gestalten, da ihnen häufig wichtige Angaben zur Krankheits-und Medikationshistorie der Pat. fehlen. Zudem sind Ll häufig nicht auf Behandlungsnotwendigkeiten multimorbider Pat. ausgerichtet. In den letzten Jahren hat sich der Altersdurchschnitt der Patienten, die zu einer Nierentransplantation anstehen, kontinuierlich nach oben entwickelt. Derzeit sind bereits mehr als 30 Prozent der bei Eurotrans-plant gemeldeten, potentiellen Organempfänger älter als 65 Jahre. Aus der täglichen Praxis bekannt und durch Studien gut belegt, sind gerade ältere Transplantatempfänger im Vergleich zu den jüngeren sehr ""vulnerabel"". Neben einer deutlich höheren kardiovaskuläre Mortalität und einem signifikant größeren Tumorrisiko findet sich bei ihnen eine hohe Rate an Infektionen und chronischen Transplantatabstoßung. 50 % dieser Transplantierten versterben sehr früh mit einem gut funktionierenden Graft. In Anbetracht dieser Tatsachen ist eine perfekte Risikostratifizierung im Vorfeld einer geplanten Transplantation verbunden mit einer individuellen Therapieplanung für eine erfolgreiche Nierentransplantatin unumgänglich. Eigene Studien belegen das besonders hohe Risiko für Frailty mit den bekannt negativen Folgen für die betroffenen Patienten. Die zweite große Herausforderung liegt im perioperativen Management. Gerade alte Nierenpatienten tolerieren postoperative Komplikationen nur sehr schlecht. Psychoorganische Syndrome mit Verlust von Funktionalität sind die Folgen. Studien belegen, dass innerhalb des ersten postoperativen Jahres das Risiko von unerwünschten Sekundärereignissen am größten ist. Überstehen die betroffenen Patienten diesen Zeitraum ohne größere Organschäden, haben sie die gleich gute Lebenserwartung wie die gesunde Normalbevölkerung. Die dritte Herausforderung ist das Langzeitoutcome nach einer erfolgreichen Nierentransplantation. Dabei spielen u.a. Faktoren wie die Art des Donors (Leichen-oder Lebendnierenspende), das Spenderalter, die kalte Ischämiezeit des transplantierten Organs, und vorangegangene akute oder chronische Abstoßungsreaktionen eine entscheidende Rolle. Noch sind einige wichtige Fragen nicht geklärt: Welches Organ für welchen Empfänger? Die Art der Immunsuppression? Das Problem der Polypharmazie und dem damit verbunden Risiko für das Transplantat-bzw. Empfängerüberleben, Verbesserung in der postoperativen Nachbetreuung. -Alle diese Herausforderungen können nur durch ein interdisziplinär agierendes Team gelöst werden. Neben den Transplantchirurgen, den Anästhesisten, den Pflegekräften und den Nephrologen wird in Zukunft der Geriater zusammen mit den Physio-und Ergotherapeuten bzw. den Diätologen eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Es bedarf aber weiterhin des großen Einsatzes aller Beteiligter und noch vieler Studien, um ein gut funktionierendes, auf das Individuum zugeschnittenes, ""Nephro-Transplant-Geriatrisches"" Behandlungskonzept zu erstellen. Resultate dreier multizentrischer nichtinterventioneller Studien Einleitung. Bis zu 40% der über 65-Jährigen leiden an einer Eisenmangelanämie. Neben nutritiven Faktoren gelten Resorptions-und/ oder Verwertungsstörungen im Rahmen chronischer Erkrankungen als Hauptursache. Die damit verbunden Symptome führen zu signifikanten Einschränkungen kognitiver sowie koordinativ-motorischer Fähigkeiten mit einem erhöhten Risiko für Invalidität, Morbidität und Mortalität. In den drei hier vorgestellten nichtinterventionellen Studien Background: Although the number of older patients is increasing in almost all medical specialties, the interest of medical students in geriatrics as a career is still low. Because quality of medical education and educators strongly influences student career decisions, it is important to develop curricula that motivate students to become self-directed, lifelong learners in the field of geriatric medicine. Objectives: We evaluated training aspects in terms of time, core content of teaching goals, and quality of undergraduate geriatric education in medical schools in Austria and Germany. Methods: A standardized paper questionnaire was sent to all 36 German and 4 Austrian medical faculties to evaluate quantitative aspects, con-tent, and quality of pre-graduate medical education in geriatrics. Results were compared to the recommendations of the Geriatric Medicine Section of the European Union of Medical Specialistst (UEMS). Results: A total of 33/6 (92%) of the German medical faculties and 4/4 (100%) of the Austrian medical faculties responded to the questionnaire. In most of the faculties, geriatric medicine was taught as an independent discipline in the core curriculum, with learning objectives absent in almost one third of the faculties. A medical student´s first contact with geriatric medicine occured on average during the second clinical year (median 8th semester). Although the content of geriatric curricula strongly varied among the faculties, sore knowledge as recommended by the UEMS was integrated into most of the curricula. Teaching strategies regarding the development of attitudes and skills also recommended by the UEMS were identified in the curriculum of only some faculties. Conclusion: Geriatrics seems to be an established subject in most German and Austrian faculties. However, the current data clearly indicate highly variable quality in geriatric pregraduate training at German and Austrian universities. Because curricula should prepare young people using competence-based training and assessment methods, room for improvement remains not only in terms of structure, but also regarding quality of training to develop self-directed life-long learners. |"
722	c3461b2484a2c1b0532e47afba87d235e350b9e7	De novo transcriptome reconstruction and annotation of the Egyptian rousette bat	Background: The Egyptian Rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a common fruit bat species found throughout Africa and the Middle East, was recently identified as a natural reservoir host of Marburg virus. With Ebola virus, Marburg virus is a member of the family Filoviridae that causes severe hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and nonhuman primates, but results in little to no pathological consequences in bats. Understanding host-pathogen interactions within reservoir host species and how it differs from hosts that experience severe disease is an important aspect of evaluating viral pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics and methods of prevention. Results: Progress in studying bat reservoir host responses to virus infection is hampered by the lack of host-specific reagents required for immunological studies. In order to establish a basis for the design of reagents, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome. We performed de novo transcriptome assembly using deep RNA sequencing data from 11 distinct tissues from one male and one female bat. We observed high similarity between this transcriptome and those available from other bat species. Gene expression analysis demonstrated clustering of expression profiles by tissue, where we also identified enrichment of tissue-specific gene ontology terms. In addition, we identified and experimentally validated the expression of novel coding transcripts that may be specific to this species. Conclusion: We comprehensively characterized the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome de novo. This transcriptome will be an important resource for understanding bat immunology, physiology, disease pathogenesis, and virus transmission.	For validation, RNA was extracted from the spleen tissue of both the male and female bats using Trizol LS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 μg of RNA using the Superscript III First-strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Amplicons for each of the primer sets were generated using Phusion HotStart Flex DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Ipswitch, MA) and run on a 1.5 % agarose gel for visualization. The correct size amplicon was gel extracted, quantified, and Sanger sequenced on the Applied Biosystems 3730×1 DNA Analyzer.|

Nasal and throat swabs were collected from 397 children with URTIs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were collected from 323 children with LRTIs. RT-PCR/PCR was used to examine all samples for IFV, PIV, RSV, RV, hMPV, HBoV, CoV, ADV, RSV, and EV. Viral pathogens were detected in 47.10% of URTI samples and 66.57% samples, and the incidence of viral coinfection was 5.29% and 21.05%, respectively. IFV was the most common virus in URTIs, with a detection rate of 19.40%, followed by PIV (10.83%), RV (10.58%), and EV (6.30%). For LRTIs, PIV and RV were both detected in 27% of samples, followed by RSV (9.91%), HBoV (8.36%), IFV (5.57%), and hMPV (5.57%). RSV and HBoV were more prevalent in the youngest children of no more than six months. Meanwhile, RV, PIV, and RSV were the most frequent viruses combined with bacterial pathogens in LRTIs. In conclusion, the spectrum of respiratory virus infections in URTIs and LRTIs differed in terms of the most common pathogens, seasonal distribution, and coinfection rate.	In summary, we compared the spectrum, seasonality, age distribution, and coinfection of respiratory virus infections in children with URTIs and LRTIs. Our data show that the viral epidemiology differed between URTIs and LRTIs. It is necessary to monitor respiratory viruses over long periods of time to determine their epidemiology.|

In the 1980's and 1990's HIV/AIDS was the emerging infectious disease. In 2003-2004 we saw the emergence of SARS, Avian influenza and Anthrax in a man made form used for bioterrorism. Emergency powers legislation in Australia is a patchwork of Commonwealth quarantine laws and State and Territory based emergency powers in public health legislation. It is time for a review of such legislation and time for consideration of the efficacy of such legislation from a country wide perspective in an age when we have to consider the possibility of mass outbreaks of communicable diseases which ignore jurisdictional boundaries.	The law is an important tool in supporting the management of the outbreak of infectious diseases. The existence of our Federal system has meant that we have a different approach in each State and Territory together with Commonwealth control of quarantine. Newly emerging infectious diseases creating real threats to public health in an era of easy mass travel, and the present threat of bioterrorism mean that it is time Australia examined all laws to contain and manage infectious disease outbreak. The laws should be examined both for their effectiveness in the areas they cover, and as part of a whole which ought enable a response which protects the health of all Australians, and crosses borders as easily as SARS or avian influenza.|

That said, the nearly 100% mortality rate in confirmed DIM cases leads us to the conclusion that little stands to be lost in trying new treatments. Research is ongoing to unravel the aetiology (and possible prevention or treatment) of this severe and emerging disease syndrome.|

This 27-yearold woman at her 30 and 3/7 weeks' gestation was referred to our center with fever, myalgia, and cough. The laboratory investigations showed leukopenia and lymphopenia as well as increased creatinine and CRP levels. The first chest X-ray (faint bilateral patchy opacities) and CT scan (some faint subpleural ground-glass opacities associated with pleural thickening) were not typical for initial COVID-19 pulmonary infection, however, the treatment for COVID-19 was started. Due to respiratory distress, she was intubated and put under mechanical ventilation. After a while, the fetus was born with Apgar score of 0 and did not react to the neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol. Finally, due to deterioration in the clinical and imaging findings, the patient was expired as a result of multi-organ failure. Following the death, autopsy was performed and the histopathologic evaluations of the lungs showed evidence of viral pneumonia (viral cytopathic effect and a mild increase in alveolar wall thickness) and ARDS (hyaline membrane). Also, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of maternal death with confirmed COVID-19 infection.	Authors declare no actual or potential conflict of interest related to this study.|

Single-genome projects provide the greatest resolution for identifying genetic factors responsible for specific virulence phenotypes and provide answers to many important questions, such as: What is the minimal gene set in a pathogen required to cause a specific disease phenotype? What does the genetic context of virulence or antibiotic resistance factors tell us about their evolutionary origin or the mobility between different microbial species or even genera? Population-level genome sequencing projects provide us with information about the pangenomic gene pool and the potential of a species to evolve into a novel pathogen. Are certain bacterial species or strains more likely than others to evolve pathogenic traits? What distinguishes a commensal from a pathogenic isolate? What provides the trigger or ability to convert a commensal or opportunistic strain into a pathogen? What role does horizontal gene transfer play in species evolution? Is an infection always caused by an individual isolate or might infection be caused by a combination of individuals in a population that all have different attenuated infectious potentials? Metagenomics projects sample the genetic reservoir (the set of genes carried by all members of a community) within a specific environment or sample. This ''gene soup'' reflects the maximum genetic potential accessible to individual isolates by horizontal gene transfer.|

Seroepidemiologic survey of coronavirus (strain 229E) infections in a population of children. Am J Epidemiol 101:238-244, 1975.-The indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test for coronavirus 229E antibodies was used for serodiagnostic and seroepidemiologic studies in a population of children. Subjects ranged in age from 5 to 19 years and lived in a home which participated in a longitudinal surveillance of respiratory illness (1960)(1961)(1962)(1963)(1964)(1965)(1966)(1967)(1968). During this period 1477 respiratory illnesses were observed; 63 (4%) were associated with sero-response (fourfold or greater antibody rises) to 229E. An additional 105 sero-responses were associated with unreported or subclinical illness. The frequency of these infections was cyclical, and 229E and coronavirus OC 43 infections peaked in different years among the same population. Sero-responses occurred mainly in the fall, winter and spring quarters. Preexisting antibody was demonstrated in one-third of the children with 229E seroresponses. Clinical studies indicated that the most frequent complaints with 229E infections were sore throat, coryza and cough, and the most frequent findings were pharyngeal injection, coryza and fever.	In previous clinical studies reported by Kapikian et al. (3) , the chief complaint of patients shedding 229E-like virus was coryza or nasal congestion followed by sneezing, sore throat, headache, cough, muscular aches, chills and fever in that order. Hendley et al. (1) found that illness due to 229E in adults was characterized mainly by nasal symptoms with little or no fever. They also found that illnesses due to OC 43 resembled colds caused by rhinoviruses and were characterized by pharyngitis, cough and nasal congestion. Our findings, based on patients with sero-response to 229E, indicate a close parallel in regard to nasal involvement. Our attending physicians saw more fever than that described by Hendley et al. (1) , although the frequency of fever with 229E was less than that described in our previous study with OC 43. The presence of preexisting antibody seemed to have no significant ameliorating effect on respiratory illness caused by 229E.|

Epitope-based vaccine design for EBOVs remains a top priority because a mere progress has been made in this regard. Another reason is the lack of antiviral drug and licensed vaccine although there is a severe outbreak in Central Africa. In this study, we aimed to design an epitope-based vaccine that can trigger a significant immune response as well as to prognosticate inhibitor that can bind with potential drug target sites using various immunoinformatics and docking simulation tools. The capacity to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity by T cell and B cell was checked for the selected protein. The peptide region spanning 9 amino acids from 42 to 50 and the sequence TLASIGTAF were found as the most potential B and T cell epitopes, respectively. This peptide could interact with 12 HLAs and showed high population coverage up to 80.99%. Using molecular docking, the epitope was further appraised for binding against HLA molecules to verify the binding cleft interaction. In addition with this, the allergenicity of the epitopes was also evaluated. In the post-therapeutic strategy, docking study of predicted 3D structure identified suitable therapeutic inhibitor against targeted protein. However, this computational epitope-based peptide vaccine designing and target site prediction against EBOVs open up a new horizon which may be the prospective way in Ebola viruses research; the results require validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.

731	ceb861e3091278448ae82342daf3d093fe7b98d2			In summary, we stand by our interpretation that exposure of the VE-cadherin binding domain in intact fibrinogen induces endothelial cell permeability and promotes transendothelial migration of malignant breast cancer cells in vitro. 1 Furthermore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that small amounts of fibrinogen produced endogenously by breast cancer cells contribute to tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions to promote breast cancer metastasis in vivo. The striking ob-servation that intact fibrinogen was unable to induce barrier endothelial permeability in the presence of MCF-10A nonmalignant breast epithelial cells (please see Fig. 6 and Discussion in Ref. 1) led us to further hypothesize that nonmalignant breast epithelial cells bind fibrinogen b 15-42 sequences, likely through cell surface HSPGs, rendering the VE-cadherin binding domain at fibrinogen b 15-42 inaccessible. The ability of nonmalignant breast epithelial cells to bind fibrinogen b and the loss of such binding capacity by malignant breast cancer cells suggests a molecular mechanism by which premalignant breast epithelial cells transform to a highly aggressive metastatic breast cancer phenotype. Further studies in animal models of breast cancer metastasis will permit us to test the validity of these hypotheses.|

Oxidative stress is attributed to such pathological condition that further contributes to the initiation and progression of liver injury. In the present study, we have investigated if the strong antioxidant power of Nicotinamide (NA), Vitamin B2 (VB2), and Vitamin C (VC) can ameliorate TAA-induced oxidative stress-mediated liver injury in the rats. Methods: Thirty-six albino rats were divided into six groups: Control group; TAA group (IP injection with TAA at a dosage of 200 mg/Kg three times a week for two months); TAA + NA group (rats administered with NA at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily besides TAA as in the control); TAA + VB2 group (rats administered with vitamin B2 at a dosage of 30 mg/kg daily besides injection with TAA); TAA + VC group (rats administered with vitamin C at a dosage of 200 mg/kg daily along with injection of TAA). TAA + NA + VB + VC group (rats administered the with the three vitamins daily in TAA pre-injected at the respective doses described above). Results: Treatment of rats with TAA led to a significant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total bilirubin, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the serum samples. Moreover, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline and nitic oxide (NO) were also significantly increased in the TAA-treated rats, while reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly compromised in the hepatic samples. Rats administered with NA, VB2, and VC as individually or in combination ameliorated the deleterious effects of TAA that was confirmed by histopathology. However, the combination of the three vitamins was found more effective as compared to each of the vitamins. Conclusion: Our work demonstrates that NA, VB2, and VC cross-talk with each other that act as a more potent biochemical chain of antioxidant defense against TAA-induced toxicities in vivo.	The present study entails the combination of NA, VB2, and VC has stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power as compared to the individual potential of the vitamins against TAA-induced toxicity. The three vitamins exert the protective effects through their antioxidant, antifibrosis and anti-inflammatory properties that consequently restore the structure and functionality of the target organs. Hence, anti-oxidative therapy mainly comprising of natural antioxidants represents a reasonable therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stressmediated liver diseases. |
733	7ed1dcfad7266bfda122685c0009ec526f77909f	interferon Lambda: Modulating immunity in infectious Diseases	Interferon lambdas (IFN-λs; IFNL1-4) modulate immunity in the context of infections and autoimmune diseases, through a network of induced genes. IFN-λs act by binding to the heterodimeric IFN-λ receptor (IFNLR), activating a STAT phosphorylationdependent signaling cascade. Thereby hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes are induced, which modulate various immune functions via complex forward and feedback loops. When compared to the well-characterized IFN-α signaling cascade, three important differences have been discovered. First, the IFNLR is not ubiquitously expressed: in particular, immune cells show significant variation in the expression levels of and susceptibilities to IFN-λs. Second, the binding affinities of individual IFN-λs to the IFNLR varies greatly and are generally lower compared to the binding affinities of IFN-α to its receptor. Finally, genetic variation in the form of a series of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to genes involved in the IFN-λ signaling cascade has been described and associated with the clinical course and treatment outcomes of hepatitis B and C virus infection. The clinical impact of IFN-λ signaling and the SNP variations may, however, reach far beyond viral hepatitis. Recent publications show important roles for IFN-λs in a broad range of viral infections such as human T-cell leukemia type-1 virus, rotaviruses, and influenza virus. IFN-λ also potentially modulates the course of bacterial colonization and infections as shown for Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the immunological processes involved in controlling viral and bacterial infections are distinct, IFN-λs may interfere at various levels: as an innate immune cytokine with direct antiviral effects; or as a modulator of IFN-α-induced signaling via the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 inhibitory feedback loops. In addition, the modulation of adaptive immune functions via macrophage and dendritic cell polarization, and subsequent priming, activation, and proliferation of pathogen-specific T-and B-cells may also be important elements associated with infectious disease outcomes. This review summarizes the emerging details of the IFN-λ immunobiology in the context of the host immune response and viral and bacterial infections.

The puppies were treated with trimethoprime and sulphamethoxazole @ 40 mg/kg body weight in combination with metronidazole @ 10 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 5 days which was supported with fluid therapy, aniemetics and plasma expanders. All the animals showed completed clinical recovery along with clearing of faecal oocyst.	The recovery of the puppies by administration of trimethoprime and sulphamethoxazole along with supportive therapies and metronidazole resulted in complete clinical recovery with elimination of faecal oocyst. Similarly use of Sulfadimethoxine alone and in combination with ormetoprim has been proved effective in canines and felines (Wilkinson 1977; Dunbar and Foreyt 1985; Lindsay and Blagburn 1995) . Administrations of emodepside plus toltrazuril suspension in combination with oral Amprolium have proven effectiveness against canine infection (Altreuther et al. 2011) . Anti-giardial drugs like metronidazole, tinidazole, quinacrine, and furazolidone have very limited effect but metronidazole has been reported successful in some cases (Trier et al. 1974; Syrkis et al. 1975; Butler and deBoer 1981; Hallak et al. 1982; Forthal and Guest 1984; Weiss et al. 1988 ). The major aim of the treatment includes reduction of clinical signs along with reduction in faecal oocysts for interrupting the life cycle (Daugschies et al. 2000; Buehl et al. 2006 ). Supportive therapies like fluid administration are done depending on the severity of clinical signs which can enhance the recovery of the animals (Altreuther et al. 2011) . It was concluded that the canine Isosporosis can be clinically managed by use of trimethoprime and sulphamethoxazole along with supportive therapies and metronidazole. The major concern of the treatment should include elimination of faecal oocyst for interrupting life cycle of the disease.|

If a patient returns with diarrhea, stool should be sent for culture (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter) and ova and parasite (O&P) three times. Respiratory symptoms may result from viral infections and should be evaluated in much the same way as for nontravelers. Because tuberculosis (TB) is rarely acquired by short-term travelers, it should be more seriously considered in those having been abroad for months or years and an acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear should be done. Domestic infections should also be considered (e.g., urinary tract infection [UTI] , upper respiratory infection [URI]). I.

We reevaluated 81 children who had been prospectively followed up since hospitalization for wheezing at less than 2 years of age. The baseline data on characteristics of the children, family-related factors, and viral causes of wheezing were collected on entry into the study. At the median age of 12.3 years, current symptoms suggestive of asthma and allergy were recorded. As part of the clinical examination, an outdoor exercise challenge test and skin prick tests to common inhalant allergens were performed. Asthma, as indicated by current inhaled anti-inflammatory medication or repeated wheezing and positive result in the challenge test, was present in 32 (40%) children, and 90% of them were sensitized to at least one allergen. Early asthma-predictive factors were atopic dermatitis (odds ratio (OR), 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-10.1) and the presence of specific IgE to inhalant allergens (OR, 11.3; 95% CI, 1.9-67.6). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) identification during wheezing in infancy was relatively rare (20%) among later asthmatics compared with other or no viral identification (52%) or rhinovirus identification (58%). Since the prevalence of childhood asthma in our area is 4.0-5.0%, we conclude that the increased risk of asthma persists until the teenage years after hospitalization for wheezing in infancy. The risk was about 5-fold after respiratory syncytial virus-induced wheezing, and more than 10-fold after rhinovirus-induced wheezing in the present study. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2005; 40:316-323. ß 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	In conclusion, our study shows that asthma is common after early childhood wheezing in the teen years, which is a critical age for the persistence of asthma. Infants with early atopy and wheezing induced by viruses other than RSV carry the highest risk for chronic asthma. At this young age, atopy is often silent, with a later onset of clinical symptoms. Our result, that the presence of specific IgE antibodies to inhaled allergens in infancy predicted asthma in teenage years, confirms the validity of the algorithms applied in recent studies, including early sensitization to aeroallergens as a major risk factor for asthma. 31 Thus, laboratory tests are indicated to reveal silent atopy in wheezing infants, at least in severe cases requiring hospitalization, and if clinical or laboratory findings of atopy are present, a follow-up, lasting until school age or even longer, should be considered.|

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that intra-nasal BCG treatment is capable of enhancing an established allergendriven inflammatory response by markedly hindering the development of the Th2-dependent downstream effector phase of allergy. The results showed evidence of the coexistence of immune deviation and regulatory mechanisms for the modulating effect on Th2-airway inflammation by BCG. The increased production of IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β associated with a higher Foxp3 and CTLA-4 expression seemed to be decisive in this inhibitory effect. Moreover, mycobacteria treatment induces IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells, suggesting participation of other important regulating mechanisms in addition to CD4 + T regulatory cells. Although a therapeutic role for BCG is compatible with the current version of the hygiene hypothesis, analysis of this hypothesis is in progress and the exact mechanism of how BCG exerts its effects remains open. Therefore, further studies should be carried out to elucidate whether it will be possible to use mycobacteria selectively to induce allergen-specific T regulatory cells. Furthermore, new insights into the mechanisms of action of BCG treatment should help to understand the abnormalities of the immune response resulting in allergic diseases.|

It is still uncertain whether this sovereign concern will trump the provision of global public good for health. Nevertheless, in a highly globalizing world, infectious diseases know no border. While China is seeking to adhere as much as possible to the underlying norms and rules of global health governance (and sometimes even applies them to their extremes), as evidenced by its handling of the recent swine flu outbreak, the major step forward is perhaps to reframe health as a global public good that is available to each and every individual of the world, rather than merely as an issue of concern to nation-states.|

In 16-day studies, rats were fed diets containing 0, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 ppm of theophylline or given 0, 12.5 (twice daily), 25 (once daily), 50 (once daily), 50 (twice daily), 100 (once daily), 200 (once daily), 200 (twice daily), and 400 (once daily) mg theophylline/kg body weight in corn oil by gavage. In 14-week studies, rats were fed diets containing 0, 1000, 2000, and 4000 ppm theophylline or given 0, 37.5, 75, and 150 mg/kg body weight theophylline in corn oil by gavage. In 2-year gavage studies, rats were given 0, 7.5, 25, and 75 mg/kg body weight in corn oil. In 16-day gavage studies, treatment-related periarteritis occurred in arteries of the pancreas and adjacent to the mesenteric lymph nodes of early death male and female rats given 400 mg/kg once daily. In the 14-week studies, treatment-related periarteritis occurred at similar sites and in male rats exposed to 75 and 150 mg/kg, and in all exposed female rats (gavage studies), in females exposed to 1000 ppm, and in both sexes exposed to 2000 and 4000 ppm (feeding studies). In the 2-year study, chronic periarteritis was signi®cantly increased only in the males receiving 75 mg/kg of theophylline. The adventitia, media and intima of medium-and large-sized mesenteric arteries were involved. Similar to other vasodilator chemicals, the pathogenesis of theophylline-induced vascular lesions may be a consequence of hemodynamic changes induced in the vascular wall.	In the 2-year studies, theophylline was tested at doses which were approximately 3 to 12 times greater than normal human exposure (Kodama et al. 1980 ). In the assessment of the arteritis induced by the infusion of rats with UK-61,260, a cAMP PDE III inhibitor, it was concluded that the arterial lesions were linked to exaggerated pharmacological eects, and therefore not considered a potential risk to human patients (Hanton et al. 1995) . Theophylline-related arterial lesions were noted only in male rats given the highest dose (75 mg/kg), which is approximately 12 times greater than the human therapeutic dose. Therefore, it is not considered of a potential risk to humans (Hanton et al. 1995) .|

These SQGs are useful for a screening line of evidence (LOE) that can be combined with other LOEs in a full weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of impacted sites. Three common multichemical hazard quotient methods (probable effect concentration [PEC]-Q avg , PEC-Q met , and PEC-Q sum ) and a novel (hazard score [HZD]) approach were used in conjunction with a consensus-based set of SQGs to evaluate the ability of different scoring metrics to predict the biological effects of sediment contamination under field conditions. Multivariate analyses were first used to categorize river sediments into distinct habitats based on a set of physicochemical parameters to include gravel, low and high flow sand, and silt. For high flow sand and gravel, no significant dose-response relationships between numerically dominant species and various toxicity metric scores were observed. Significant dose-response relationships were observed for chironomid abundances and toxicity scores in low flow sand and silt habitats. For silt habitats, the HZD scoring metric provided the best predictor of chironomid abundances compared to various PEC-Q methods according to goodness-of-fit tests. For low flow sand habitats, PEC-Q sum followed by HZD, provided the best predictors of chironomid abundance. Differences in apparent chironomid toxicity between the 2 habitats suggest habitat-specific differences in chemical bioavailability and indicator taxa sensitivity. Using an IBI method, the HZD, PEC-Q avg , and PEC-Q met approaches provided reasonable correlations with calculated IBI values in both silt and low flow sand habitats but not for gravel or high flow sands. Computation differences between the various multi-chemical toxicity scoring metrics and how this contributes to bias in different estimates of chemical mixture toxicity scores are discussed and compared. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:410-422. C 2016 SETAC	SQGs, such as those implemented by MDEQ, are useful for providing toxicity benchmarks on which to evaluate sediment contamination and potential of sediments to contribute to degraded benthos. However, these guidelines cannot be used appropriately without considering the interactive effects of mixtures of chemicals present in the field and different habitats present within the system. Various multicontaminant toxicity score approaches have been developed. However, different scoring methods generate different estimates of sediment toxicity and each computational approach contains within it assumptions that can contribute to biases in the prediction. This study demonstrated the applicability of some common multi-chemical multivariate scoring approaches for predicting benthic invertebrate abundance and indices of biological integrity (IBI) under field conditions. It further describes a new method (HZD) that adopts a multipoint calibration through incorporation of information provided by PEC and TEC benchmark values. The HZD score and individual PEC-Q approaches were capable of predicting Chironomidae abundances and IBI score values in 2 types of Detroit River habitats with varying degrees of success. The HZD approach provided the best estimate of chironomid abundance in silt habitat, whereas PEC-Q sum produced the best estimate of chironomid abundance in low flow sand habitats followed closely by the HZD score as the second best metric. As for the multivariate approaches, the multimetric IBI approach showed correlations in the Silt and LSand habitats for each of the SQG scoring metrics. However, none of the metrics were able to predict abundances of other organism groups and habitat types indicating some limitations of the toxicity interpretation of SQGs across habitat types and species. This implies that habitat-and taxonomic-specific SQGs are likely warranted. Overall, the universality of SQGs is generally limited by: 1) the types of organisms present in the local environment and their tolerance to contaminant and habitat quality; 2) differences in contaminant availability based on site physical and chemical characteristics; and 3) unknown toxicological interactions of multiple contaminants at a site. Overall, the SQG LOE screening can be useful as part of a full WOE assessment of sites to identify impacts of contamination on the sediment benthos. The method is made more powerful when habitat characteristics are considered within the SQG LOE assessment process and this has the added advantage of adopting consistency in approach with other LOEs that exclusively consider biological community composition alterations relative to habitat matched reference locations.

The role that rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses and human bocavirus play in pediatric pneumonia is insufficiently studied. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study 9 virus groups, including 16 different viruses or viral strains, in 56 ambulatory children with radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The same tests were carried out on 474 apparently healthy control children of the same age and sex. The mean age of children with CAP was 6.5 years (SD 4.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found in 19.6 % of 56 cases and in 2.1 % of 474 controls. Adenoviruses were present in 12.5 % of cases (0.2 % controls) and metapneumovirus and influenza A virus each in 10.7 % of cases (0.2 % controls). Interestingly, rhinoviruses were less common in cases (10.7 %) than in controls (22.4 %): odds ratio 0.36 (95%CI) 0.15-0.87) in conditional logistic regression including 56 cases and 280 controls matched for age, sex and sampling month. The prevalence of parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses and human bocavirus were similar in both groups.

Impelling is to start an argumentation on this problem that aims to establish a shared conduct in dealing with them. The authors propose a basis for discussion on which to begin a constructive debate.	"1) long-term care facilities: in a setting where specialist expertise is not widespread, the role of bodies responsible for controlling the spread of infections, with the aid of specialized individuals, becomes essential in disseminating appropriate organization and control measures. In this setting, any responsibility for delays and omissions certainly cannot be attributed to the managers of these territorial facilities. Responsibilities have therefore to be ascribed to the competent public health bodies and control authorities from the moment they are informed; 2) general practitioners: specific training and support for the management and control of their professional exposure should be carefully coordinated at top management level, and translated into timely action. All these problems will demand an ""economically sustainable"" response, that will affect the budgeting of health organizations and insurance companies alike. At the time of writing, the situation may still not be entirely clear. It will take a while to find solutions for all the problems in the longer term. It will be essential to strike the correct balance between the rights of damaged individuals and the proper safeguarding of health-care professionals in a frame that considers the responsibilities of the whole health system. This system should be submitted to a necessary, and not selfreferential auditing process.|"

Previously, we developed a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of MERS-CoV [Virol J. 2014. 11:139]. Generally, amplification of RT-LAMP is monitored by the turbidity induced by precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate with newly synthesized DNA. However, this mechanism cannot completely exclude the possibility of unexpected reactions. Therefore, in this study, fluorescent RT-LAMP assays using quenching probes (QProbes) were developed specifically to monitor only primer-derived signals. Two primer sets (targeting nucleocapsid and ORF1a sequences) were constructed to confirm MERS cases by RT-LAMP assay only. Our data indicate that both primer sets were capable of detecting MERS-CoV RNA to the same level as existing genetic diagnostic methods, and that both were highly specific with no cross-reactivity observed with other respiratory viruses. These primer sets were highly efficient in amplifying target sequences derived from different MERS-CoV strains, including camel MERS-CoV. In addition, the detection efficacy of QProbe RT-LAMP was comparable to that of real-time RT-PCR assay using clinical specimens from patients in Saudi Arabia. Altogether, these results indicate that QProbe RT-LAMP assays described here can be used as powerful diagnostic tools for rapid detection and surveillance of MERS-CoV infections.

If the PCR starting process fails, the entire PCR fails. Primer sequences at the 3 -end often interfere with success in PCR experiments. Over 2000 primer sequences from successful PCR experiments used with varieties of templates and conditions were analyzed for finding frequencies of the 3 -end triplets. This chapter discusses a trend in 3 -end triplet frequencies in primers used in successful PCR experiments and proposes requirements for the 3 -end of a primer. Finally, a method to select primers with the best 3 -end triplets is introduced based on the 3 -end analysis result.	"• Case of Vector NTI Advance 9.1 In ""3 -end"" tab of ""find primer"" window of Vector NTI, click off A and T for first nucleotide and leave the rest for both sense and anti-sense primer 3 . • Case of DS Gene 1. 5 Use the default settings (""S"" should be appeared in ""3 -dinucleotide"" field). 5 . In most programs, e.g., in Primer3, the list of primer candidates is sorted from the best to the worst. So, try to find primers with TTS, SWS, and WSS at the 3 -ends near the top of the list to find the best scored primer pairs with the best triplet selection. 6. Primer pairs that should be avoided have been discarded by step 3. Rest of primer pairs are neither extremely preferred nor not-preferred ones. Thus, an average success rate in the PCR experiment can be expected from the primer pairs. 7. Recording primer pair ID number from the primer design program will help tracking primer pairs after sorting the spreadsheet in later processes.|"

Vaccines have greatly improved the therapeutic landscape for treating infectious diseases and have significantly reduced the threat by therapeutic and preventative approaches. Furthermore, the advent of recombinant technologies has greatly facilitated growth within the vaccine realm by mitigating risks such as virulence reversion despite making the production processes more cumbersome. In addition, seroconversion can also be enhanced by recombinant technology through kinetic and nonkinetic approaches, which are discussed herein. Recombinant technologies have greatly improved both amino acid-based vaccines and DNA-based vaccines. A plateau of interest has been reached between 2001 and 2010 for the scientific community with regard to DNA vaccine endeavors. The decrease in interest may likely be attributed to difficulties in improving immunogenic properties associated with DNA vaccines, although there has been research demonstrating improvement and optimization to this end. Despite improvement, to the extent of our knowledge, there are currently no regulatory body-approved DNA vaccines for human use (four vaccines approved for animal use). This article discusses engineering DNA vaccines against infectious diseases while discussing advantages and disadvantages of each, with an emphasis on applications of these DNA vaccines.	To further the development of vaccines with improved functionality, an interdisciplinary-focused research will be of great utility. In light of research discussed herein, the vaccine realm will be experiencing great improvements in the following areas in the coming years: further optimization of vaccine scheduling; duration of protection through nonkinetic approaches; enhancement of antigen stability; improved immunogenicity of DNA vaccines; manufacturing and engineering vaccines in general, and the ability to control gene circuits for gene-modulating technologies.|

758	cb170da8bdb911044eb8e7a5daa603fef8927bd2		Viruses, the molecular nanomachines infecting hosts ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, come in different sizes, shapes, and symmetries. Questions such as what principles govern their structural organization, what factors guide their assembly, how these viruses integrate multifarious functions into one unique structure have enamored researchers for years. In the last fi ve decades, following Caspar and Klug's elegant conceptualization of how viruses are constructed, high-resolution structural studies using X-ray crystallography and more recently cryo-EM techniques have provided a wealth of information on structures of a variety of viruses. These studies have signifi cantly furthered our understanding of the principles that underlie structural organization in viruses. Such an understanding has practical impact in providing a rational basis for the design and development of antiviral strategies. In this chapter, we review principles underlying capsid formation in a variety of viruses, emphasizing the recent developments along with some historical perspective.	"The quasi-equivalence theory proposed almost half a century ago has been remarkably useful in describing icosahedral virus structure. The generality of its predictions arises from the simplicity afforded by the assumption that groups of subunits packing in a plane are energetically favored to have six neighbors (i.e., are hexagonally close-packed) and that curvature can be generated by introducing nodes (vertices) with only fi ve such neighbors. However, such generality and adaptability can come at the cost of specifi city. The propensity for subunits to form quasi-equivalent interactions leading to a wrong (usually smaller and simpler) fi nal capsid structure indicates that more information is sometimes required. So we observe that in some viruses with T = 7 symmetry, such as P22, scaffolding proteins are used either as a template core around which a proper-sized capsid can form, or, more subtly, to control the relative proportion of subunits which adopt hexameric interactions to those which form pentamers. This idea of altering the stability of one conformational form over another is also exemplifi ed in the RNA viruses, where the RNA plays a role in stabilizing capsid proteins in the proper ratio of conformations. In the members of Reoviridae , the inner core layer forms a simple T = 1 ""permanent scaffold"" from 60 dimers, upon which the T = 13 outer layers are built. In adenovirus and herpesvirus, the role of scaffolding is augmented by the incorporation of accessory proteins in the capsid shell, which also appear to function to infl uence the curvature, and therefore the triangulation number of the capsid shell. Finally, the tendency for hexagonal close packing to be a controlling infl uence in virus assembly appears to be so robust that in the case of polyomavirus, where pentamers seem to be the only oligomeric species present, pentamers come to occupy the hexavalent positions. The exceptions to the quasi-equivalence theory prove the rule.|"

However, it is a challenge for clinicians to make an accurate and rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. This study aimed at determining whether combined biomarkers can provide a useful tool for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Methods: A retrospective study was carried out. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The patients with bacterial meningitis had significantly elevated levels of the above mentioned biomarkers. The two biomarkers were all risk factors with bacterial meningitis. The biomarkers were constructed into a ""bioscore"". The discriminative performance of the bioscore was better than that of each biomarker, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.842 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.770-0.914; p< 0.001)."	In conclusion, this retrospective study demonstrated that combination of DcR3 and sTREM-1 in CSF could yielded a better diagnostic value for nosocomial bacterial meningitis than that of each biomarker.

It has found wide applications in industries and our daily lives. This paper overviews some of these applications and provides an industrial perspective. It starts from discussing aerosol filtration theory, followed by a brief review on the advancement of filtration media. After that, filtration applications in respiratory protection, dust collection, and engine in-take air cleaning are elaborated. These are the areas that the author sees as the typical needed ones in China's fast pace economical development endeavor, where air filtration enables the protection of human health, environment and equipment for sustainability.	Aerosol filtration has seen enormous advancement in the past decades based on customers' increasing demand for small size, high efficiency, and low pressure drop of a filtration system. Emission regulation also drives the evolution of filter media technology as well as filter configuration optimization. It is anticipated that the demand can only become stronger for human health protection and sustainable growth. Since filtration systems are to be challenged by different aerosol contaminants in different environment in the real world, developing robust filtration technology with better flexibility and functionality without significantly increasing the cost is expected to be the future trend. However, this can only be achieved by applying the existing knowledge, understanding the limitation of current technology, and interfacing with other disciplines to explore the possibility of the next big thing in aerosol filtration. In my personal opinion, breakthrough technologies may come from three aspects: (a) a deeper level of aerosol characterization, not only to understand its size and size distribution, but also to learn about its chemical-physical properties, especially for bio-aerosol that threatens human health directly; (b) fiber technology. Nanofibers will be further explored in terms of method, material capability and cost reduction. However, nanofiber with purposely designed functionalities such as anti-microbial, structural features and environmental compatibility are something major to consider; (c) media technology. This looks like an extension of fiber technology on the surface, but they do differ significantly in that media technology covers more ground and is more complicated. Process engineering is pivotal to the success of filter media making in order to gain specific media properties consistently to meet the various requirements. Disruptive technologies may come from new process design and process integration based on, but not necessarily limited to the already existing technologies such as dry and wet laid, spunbond, meltspinning, electrospinning, meltblowing, as well as fiber splitting to take advantage of multicomponent fibers for filtration.|

The aim of this study was to establish the dose-response relationship of the inhibition of proteolysis as assessed by FIZ with E-64 at different dosages in a murine model of fasciolosis. Maximum effective inhibition of proteolysis was achieved at 50 mg/kg/day (87%). Mice treated with this dose survived for a mean of 10.92 days more than untreated controls, and their ova counts and egg viability were significantly (P<0.05) lower than this latter group. These results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of E-64 not only inhibited liver proteolytic activity in a dose-dependent manner but also produced antifecundity and anti-embryonation effects, delaying the progression of fasciolosis. Yet, residual proteolysis may suggest that other E-64-non-sensitive enzymes are involved, or that E-64-enzyme chemical interactions are only capable of a partial agonistic-like effect.	In summary, it is reasonable to suggest that the cysteine proteases of F. hepatica remain a promising target for the development of chemotherapeutic agents, and that the administration of E-64 together with other traditional therapies, including immunoprophylaxis, may improve clinical outcomes.|
764	3c72ead2a9cc9c0deee89ac36d97add000613d30	Silencing viruses by RNA interference	Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) makes possible new approaches for studying the various steps of the viral cycle. Plus-strand RNA viruses appear to be attractive targets for small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), as their genome functions as both mRNA and replication template. PTGS creates an alternative to classic reverse genetics for viruses with either negative-strand or double-stranded RNA genomes and for those with a large genome. PTGS allows modification of the expression of a given cellular gene as a means to elucidate its role in the viral cycle and in virus-host cell interactions, and to investigate cellular pathways involved in viral pathogenesis. It also allows the creation of new animal models of human diseases. In addition, PTGS already appears to be a promising new therapeutic tool to fight viral multiplication and dissemination through the host and to prevent inflammation and virus-induced pathogenesis, including virus-induced tumorigenesis.	For both preventive and therapeutic effects of siRNAs, it may be useful to reinforce some of the cellular pathways involved in PTGS. In animals, disease prevention by virusspecific siRNAs may be useful. In humans, the therapeutic properties of siRNAs will probably be developed before preventive applications. Today, there remain many problems concerning how to deliver the appropriate amounts of the desired siRNAs to the appropriate tissue, at the right time. These siR-NAs, after testing for the absence of toxicity, will have to be stabilized, probably by chemical modifications, in order to obtain long-lasting effects. Despite these current limitations, the siRNA technology, targeting either viral or cellular genes, is very promising for the development of treatment for diseases for which neither vaccines nor efficient therapy are currently available.|

While significant progress has been made in this area, several research and practice gaps remain. A crucial next step to advance resilience is the development of a resilience-oriented workforce. This narrative review examines existing literature to determine key components of a resilience-oriented workforce, with a focus on organizational structures, training and education, and leadership models. Reviewed articles spanned a variety of study types, including needs assessments of existing workforce, program evaluations, and reviews/commentaries. A resilience-oriented workforce spans many disciplines and training programs will need to reflect that. It requires a collaborative organizational model that promotes information sharing structures. Leadership models should foster a balance between workforce autonomy and operation as a collective entity. Optimal strategies to develop a resilience-oriented workforce have yet to be realized and future research will need to collect and synthesize data to promote and evaluate the growth of this field.	We identified that a resilience-oriented workforce spans many disciplines and requires a collaborative model that promotes information sharing structures among organizations, between organizations and individuals, across multiple levels and branches of government, and the private sector (e.g., through coalitions). IPE programs, expertise in community partnership and engagement, and dedicated post-graduate and professional development training are all needed to build a resilience-oriented workforce. Capability-based assessment tools are also needed to help track and monitor how leaders begin to embrace resilience systems thinking and to allow for career advancement that accounts for this integration. Leadership models should foster a balance between workforce autonomy and operation as a collective entity. Further, while the literature reviewed for this article were heavily focused in traditional health venues, a workforce that appreciates resilience thinking, will need to become better versed in the intersection of human systems and infrastructure systems integration.|

These putative replication complexes are composed of intimately associated but biochemically distinct membrane populations, each of which contains proteins processed from the replicase (gene 1) polyprotein. Specifically, one membrane population contains the gene 1 proteins p65 and p1a-22, while the other contains the gene 1 proteins p28 and helicase, as well as the structural nucleocapsid (N) protein and newly synthesized viral RNA. In this study, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to define the relationship of the membrane populations comprising the putative replication complexes at different times of infection in MHV-A59-infected delayed brain tumor cells. At 5.5 h postinfection (p.i.) the membranes containing N and helicase colocalized with the membranes containing p1a-22/p65 at foci distinct from sites of M accumulation. By 8 to 12 h p.i., however, the membranes containing helicase and N had a predominantly perinuclear distribution and colocalized with M. In contrast, the p1a-22/p65-containing membranes retained a peripheral, punctate distribution at all times of infection and did not colocalize with M. By late times of infection, helicase, N, and M each also colocalized with ERGIC p53, a specific marker for the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-intermediate compartment. These data demonstrated that the putative replication complexes separated into component membranes that relocalized during the course of infection. These results suggest that the membrane populations within the MHV replication complex serve distinct functions both in RNA synthesis and in delivery of replication products to sites of virus assembly.	DBT cells on glass coverslips were mock-infected or infected with MHV A59 (Hirano et al., 1976 ) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units per cell. Infections were performed at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 6% fetal calf serum (FCS). In all experiments using cycloheximide, the virus inoculant was removed from the cells at 5.5 h p.i. and replaced with DMEM containing 6% FCS and 100 g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). DMEM in parallel mockinfected wells was also replaced with cycloheximidecontaining medium at 5.5 h p.i. At the times indicated, cells were washed in 1ϫ Tris and fixed in Ϫ20°C 100% methanol. Cells were then rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). For dual-labeling studies using one primary antibody derived from rabbit and the other from mouse, primary antisera were combined in diluent containing PBS with 2% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.05% NP-40 and were incubated with the rehydrated cells for 1 h at room temperature. Primary polyclonal sera were all used at a final 1:100 dilution for each antibody, and the monoclonal anti-N (J.3.3), anti-M (J.1.3), and anti-ERGIC antibodies were each diluted 1:500. After being washed in PBS/1% BSA/0.05% NP-40, cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit and/or anti-mouse secondary antisera conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 546 dyes (Molecular Probes). The final antibody incubation for all cells was followed by washing in PBS/1% BSA/0.05% NP-40. Cells were then washed with PBS, rinsed with H 2 O, and mounted in Aquapolymount (Polysciences, Inc.) on glass slides. Immunofluorescence was detected at 488 and 543 nm using a 40ϫ oil immersion objective on the Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope in the Shared Imaging Resource of the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were obtained using the 488-nm laser. For images shown in color, red and green were artificially assigned to the grayscale images using the huesaturation option in Adobe Photoshop 5.0.|

Few studies have been conducted into the function of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp5. In this study, bioinformatics methods were employed to predict the secondary structure and construct 3-D models of the SARS-CoV GD strain nsp5. Sequencing and sequential comparison was performed to analyze the mutation trend of the polymerase nsp5 gene during the epidemic process using a nucleotide-nucleotide basic local alignment search tool (BLASTN) and a protein-protein basic local alignment search tool (BLASTP). The results indicated that the nsp5 gene was steady during the epidemic process and the protein was homologous with other coronavirus nsp5 proteins. The protein encoded by the nsp5 gene was expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This study provided the foundation for further exploration of the protein's biological function, and contributed to the search for anti-SARS-CoV drugs.	In this study, we constructed the eukaryotic recombinant expression plasmidpCI-neo-nsp5. The recombinant expression vector pCI-neo-nsp5 was transfected into COS-7 cells, and the protein was then expressed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The successful construction of the 3-D structure model, the preliminary function prediction and stable expression of nsp5 protein established the foundation for the further exploration of its actual biological function and contributed to the search for anti-SARS drugs.|

Porosity is one of the fundamental governing parameters that decides the appearance of deviation. It is observed that the macroscopic flow angle is more pronounced for lower porosities. However, the macroscopic angle decreases once a critical value of porosity is reached. The circularity (2-D) or sphericity (3-D) of the solid obstacles is an essential parameter for this phenomenon, due to the reliance of the flow on the geometry to remain attached in regions of adverse pressure gradient. The Reynolds number of the flow must be in the regime of fully turbulent flow in order for the flow to possess sufficient momentum to withstand the deviation. The effect of surface roughness on the obstacle walls was also investigated in this work by using a RANS turbulence model that simulates surface roughness by using a wall function. Surface roughness that protrudes into the turbulent boundary sublayer will force the flow to separate early and influences the macroscopic flow through a reduction in the angular deviation. There is a wealth of information that is left to be extracted that must be addressed by future work.|
769	4af539661c7141fdc618c07e38ce9aac0d1a703e	Mannose-Binding Lectin in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection	Little is known about the innate immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) infection. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a key molecule in innate immunity, functions as an anteantibody before the specific antibody response. Here, we describe a case-control study that included 569 patients with SARS and 1188 control subjects and used in vitro assays to investigate the role that MBL plays in SARS-CoV infection. The distribution of MBL gene polymorphisms was significantly different between patients with SARS and control subjects, with a higher frequency of haplotypes associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL in patients with SARS than in control subjects. Serum levels of MBL were also significantly lower in patients with SARS than in control subjects. There was, however, no association between MBL genotypes, which are associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL, and mortality related to SARS. MBL could bind SARS-CoV in a dose-and calcium-dependent and mannan-inhibitable fashion in vitro, suggesting that binding is through the carbohydrate recognition domains of MBL. Furthermore, deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV was enhanced by MBL. Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL in fetal rhesus kidney cells (FRhK-4) was also observed. These results suggest that MBL contributes to the first-line host defense against SARS-CoV and that MBL deficiency is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS.	Accumulating evidence has shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metallopeptidase, is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV that can bind to the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV [44] [45] [46] . Anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6) [44, 46] . Furthermore, a recombinant human antibody against the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV has been shown to neutralize the virus on Vero E6 cells and inhibit formation of syncytia between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing ACE2 [47] . MBL is a serum C-type lectin, and, here, we have demonstrated that MBL binds SARS-CoV per se or infected cells and inhibits the infectivity of the virus on rhesus monkey kidney cells. These findings therefore support the possible role of MBL in the host defense against SARS-CoV infection by targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV before production of specific antibody. Taken together, our findings suggest that MBL-deficient individuals are more susceptible to SARS, and they provide insight into the possible mechanisms of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection. It will be important to assess the therapeutic and prophylactic effect of replenishment of MBL in MBL knockout animal models of SARS.|

771	907e0aeb8ff4521f9f952c640a9ef34aa5cc9998	Common virus infections in cats, before and after being placed in shelters, with emphasis on feline enteric coronavirus	The purpose of this study was to determine the origin and subsequent spread of feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus (FHV), and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) in cats relinquished to shelters. FCV was isolated from the oral fauces of 11% of healthy cats upon entry, and isolation rates were highest for kittens (33%). FHV shedding was very low (4%) at the time of entry and occurred mainly in juveniles. FECV shedding was also common among newly relinquished cats (33%), especially older kittens and juveniles (90%). The subsequent spread of all three viruses was rapid and efficient in the shelter environment. Fifteen percent of cats were shedding FCV, 52% FHV, and 60% FECV after 1 week. More detailed studies were done with FECV shedding, which could be accurately quantitated. The amounts of FECV shed by infected cats ranged from 10 2 to 10 16 particles/swab of feces. FECV shedding was several logs higher in young kittens with primary infection than adult cats with primary infections. The mean levels of FECV shedding among adults were the same for primary and chronic infections. Although shelters were not the primary source of these viruses for many relinquished cats, factors intrinsic to the shelter environment were critical in amplifying shedding and spread to susceptible individuals. Extrinsic factors were especially important for the spread of FHV and FECV. FHV shedding rates increased from 4% to 50% in 1 week's time. The speed and magnitude of the increase in FHV shedding suggested that there was reactivation of latent infections as well as acquisition of new infections. FECV shedding increased 10 to 1,000,000 fold in 1 week among cats that were already infected at entry, and more than one-half of initially negative cats were shedding FECV a week later. Feline calicivirus infection was the least likely to spread in the shelter. The infection rate only increased from 11 to 15% in 1 week.	Feline calicivirus, FHV and FECV infections are brought into shelters with relinquished animals, which are shedding these viruses to varying degrees at the time of entry. FCV is brought in mainly by young kittens, whereas FECV and FHV are more apt to be introduced by older kittens and juveniles. Although shelters are not the primary source of these viruses, the shelter environment serves to spread the viruses between infected and noninfected individuals and to amplify shedding, in particular for FHV and FECV. The proportion of cats shedding FHV can go up over ten-fold in 1 week, while the incidence of FECV shedders will almost double. Factors intrinsic to the sheltering experience appear to increase FECV shedding from 10-to 1,000,000-fold after 1 week. Similar factors probably account for the dramatic increase in FHV shedding. Feline calicivirus infection is least affected by the shelter experience, probably because most cats have already been exposed prior to relinquishment.|

For an event, (which may consist of several component events, i.e., episodes), people are often interested in the whole picture of its evolution and development along a time line. This calls for modeling the dependent relationships between component events. Further, people may also be interested in component events which play important roles in the event evolution or development. To satisfy the user needs in finding and understanding the whole picture of an event effectively and efficiently, we formalize in this paper the problem of temporal event search and propose a framework of event relationship analysis for search events based on user queries. We define three kinds of event relationships which are temporal relationship, content dependence relationship, and event reference relationship for identifying to what an extent a component event is dependent on another component event in the evolution of a target event (i.e., query event). Experiments conducted on a real data set show that our method outperforms a number of baseline methods.	"Admittedly, several possible future extensions can be made to our work. In our current method, only top-5 core features are selected for event reference analysis over the collected data set. How to choose the ""right"" number of core features for event reference analysis automatically for different data sets is an open issue for further study. Another potential extension is to implement a visualization tool with a sophisticated user interface based on our current method.|"

Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often health conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health. For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below. We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform, motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have. In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform: (a) changing how the person is perceived, (b) enhancing the social behavior of the person, (c) modifying the social behavior of others, (d) providing structure for interactions, and (e) changing how the person feels. We thematically organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.

Methods The study was a retrospective analysis comparing data from a pre-multiplex era (2009) with a period after the introduction of routine respiratory multiplex analysis (2010-2013) in children with febrile seizures. Results We included 200 children with febrile seizures (mean age: 29.5 ± 1.4.months; 104 male) in the study. In 2009, in 10 out of 49 (20 %) children, microbiology testing (bacterial/fungal) was positive compared with a rate of 74 out of 151 (49 %) children during 2010-2013 (p < 0.01). The rate of positive virological studies increased from 10 (20 %) in 2009 to 73 (48.3 %) in the period 2010-2013 (p < 0.01).

The proposed selection of peptides and the ''in vitro'' assay employed in this study can thus be used for future studies. The preliminary results about the responses to FCoV peptides are encouraging but further investigations on the possible role of protein N immunostimulating epitopes. Specifically, although biased by the low number of observations and by the high individual variability, these results suggest that some sequences of FCoV protein N from ''avirulent'' or ''mixed'' strains can stimulate cell-mediated immunity, especially in cats in which cell-mediated immunity is primed by chronic diseases. Future larger studies are required to confirm the possible role of FCoV itself in stimulating the production of IFN-g, the key cytokine of cell-mediated immunity involved in the response against FCoVs and consequently responsible of viral persistence (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2003; Foley et al., 2003; Kiss et al., 2004; Berg et al., 2005; Gelain et al., 2006; Giordano and Paltrinieri, 2009 ).|
779	d268877551cde701225d92c4c89098d69173e8d9	Development of Vaccine Delivery Vehicles Based on Lactic Acid Bacteria	Live recombinant bacteria represent attractive antigen delivery systems able to induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses against heterologous antigens. The first live recombinant bacterial vectors developed were derived from attenuated pathogenic microorganisms. In addition to the difficulties often encountered in the construction of stable attenuated mutants of pathogenic organisms, attenuated pathogens may retain a residual virulence level that renders them unsuitable for the vaccination of partially immunocompetent individuals such as infants, the elderly or immunocompromised patients. As an alternative to this strategy, non-pathogenic food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) maybe used as live antigen carriers. This article reviews LAB vaccines constructed using antigens other than tetanus toxin fragment C, against bacterial, viral, and parasitic infective agents, for which protection studies have been performed. The antigens utilized for the development of LAB vaccines are briefly described, along with the efficiency of these systems in protection studies. Moreover, the key factors affecting the performance of these systems are highlighted.	To date, the data that have been obtained regarding LAB vaccines are promising because they indicate that LAB are capable of delivering antigens to the mucosal and systemic immune systems to elicit protection against infective agents. However, no clinical trials have yet been reported for LAB vaccines. The release of genetically modified organisms through clinical use raises legitimate safety concerns about their survival and propagation in the environment and about the transfer of their genetic materials such as antibiotic selection markers and the antigen encoding gene to other microorganisms. Therefore, proper biologic containment strategies should be implemented before clinical applications of LAB vaccines to prevent escape into the environment of the genetically modified microorganisms and their genetic materials. The existing food-grade expression systems for LAB, which rely on food-grade markers for selection of recombinant bacteria instead of antibiotic resistance markers, should be further expanded to inhibit transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to other microorganisms. LAB maybe considered promising vehicles not only for antigens but also for biologically active compounds such as immunomodulators, antibodies, enzymes or peptides. Genetically modified Lactococcus lactis secreting IL-10 provides a therapeutic approach for inflammatory bowl disease. To address the safety concerns related to the release of this genetically modified organism through the clinical use, the chromosomal thymidylate synthase (thyA) gene was replaced by the IL10 gene to generate a thymine auxotroph. Viability of the thyA hIL10 ? strain was reduced by several orders of magnitude in the absence of thymidine or thymine as is the case following shedding the bacterium in the environment and the containment was validated in vivo in pigs [86] . Notably, a small phase I human clinical trial conducted with the thyA hIL10 ? strain in patients with Crohn's disease showed not only that the containment strategy was effective but also the mucosal delivery of IL-10 by L. lactis is feasible in humans [87] . ActoGenix Company performed a clinical phase IIa study with the same IL-10 secreting L. lactis in human subjects with moderately active ulcerative colitis. The results of this study confirmed the suitability of the applied containment system in humans. These first clinical trials should pave the way for the development of other LAB-delivery applications in humans including vaccine delivery in the future.|

For the study participants in the non-endemic districts in China, there were no significant differences regarding these beliefs. Most study participants were confident that they were likely to recover once infected. During the epidemic of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, the government's response has included the building of two new hospitals in Wuhan, providing information to the population, and increasing the provision of medical care. The role of the media has changed, and now broadcasts the number of people who recover from COVID-19 infection each day, all of which may re-assure the population, reduce levels of anxiety, and increase their confidence. Importantly, evidence-based scientific and medical information has been provided to the population of Hubei Province and throughout China to provide awareness of COVID-19, which may reduce some of the fear caused by a lack of knowledge of this new infectious disease [33] . improve. Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine or self-isolation.

Months to years later, affected children go on to develop a chronic epilepsy with recurrent focal seizures which are often refractory to treatment. This uncommon paediatric epilepsy syndrome is poorly understood, with only a very small minority of cases associated with an underlying genetic or metabolic abnormality. We present a four-year-old girl with genetic cobalamin C deficiency who had a dramatic presentation with Hemiconvulsion-Hemiplegia-Epilepsy. She had febrile focal status epilepticus, with right hemiconvulsive seizures for nearly 10 hours, ultimately requiring a midazolam infusion. Over subsequent days, she developed progressively worsening cerebral oedema, leading to herniation and requiring a craniectomy to relieve pressure. This girl's presentation is the first association of cobalamin deficiency with hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy; and illustrates the importance of considering this entity when patients with this metabolic disorder present with acute deterioration. More importantly, the case also raises the possibility that derangements of cobalamin metabolism could be a contributing factor in cases of hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy, as well as febrile seizures in general.

In contrast to MFA studies, the spatial (origin of raw materials used) and temporal resolution (flows over a certain period of time) of such accounts are not at the focus of attention. The methodology of LCA is also not completely harmonized. LCA requires the application of cutoff criteria, for example, to which extent the physical costs of factors of production (costs for building the machinery, transport network and infrastructure development, etc.) are attributed to each unit of final product.

Four gastric bypass operations, performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were complicated with COVID-19. The mean age and body mass index were 46 ± 12 years and 49 ± 3 kg/m 2 . Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery. One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery. Three patients were readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. In two patients who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents were also administered. All patients survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery. Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.

This study characterizes Type I IFN antagonism mechanism of NS5 protein, using proteomic approach. In human neuroblastoma cells, NS5 expression would suppress IFN␤-induced responses, for example, expression of IFN-stimulated genes PKR and OAS as well as STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation. Proteomic analysis showed JEV NS5 downregulating calreticulin, while upregulating cyclophilin A, HSP 60 and stressinduced-phosphoprotein 1. Gene silence of calreticulin raised intracellular Ca 2+ levels while inhibiting nuclear translocalization of STAT1 and NFAT-1 in response to IFN␤, thus, indicating calreticulin downregulation linked with Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5 via activation of Ca 2+ /calicineurin. Calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A attenuated NS5-mediated inhibition of IFN␤-induced responses, for example, IFN-sensitive response element driven luciferase, STAT1-dependent PKR mRNA expression, as well as phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1. Transfection with calcineurin (vs. control) siRNA enhanced nuclear translocalization of STAT1 and upregulated PKR expression in NS5-expressing cells in response to IFN␤. Results prove Ca 2+ , calreticulin, and calcineurin involvement in STAT1-mediated signaling as well as a key role of JEV NS5 in Type I IFN antagonism. This study offers insights into the molecular mechanism of Type I interferon antagonism by JEV NS5.

Le principali infezioni che bisogna tentare di prevenire sono le polmoniti batteriche acquisite sotto ventilazione meccanica (PAVM), le infezioni su cateteri intravascolari e le infezioni urinarie su catetere vescicale. L'incidenza di queste infezioni è diminuita nella maggior parte dei servizi che ne effettuano un monitoraggio su base numerica, in particolare nel quadro di programmi di miglioramento della qualità. Le tecniche di prevenzione sono molteplici e devono essere applicate simultaneamente. Esse riguardano delle misure globali, come le modalità di prevenzione della trasmissione crociata (igiene delle mani, in particolare) o di utilizzo degli antibiotici nella prospettiva di ridurre la pressione di selezione di batteri resistenti agli antibiotici, così come delle misure specifiche relative al posizionamento e all'utilizzo di ciascuno dei dispositivi invasivi. Numerose tecniche si sono dimostrate efficaci in studi di buon livello metodologico (igiene delle mani, medicazioni dei cateteri, ecc.) mentre altre sono ancora oggetto di controversie, portando a raccomandazioni nazionali e internazionali regolarmente aggiornate in funzione dei nuovi dati scientifici. Queste misure, implementate in modo ragionato nel quadro di programmi di miglioramento della qualità, consentono di ottenere dei tassi molto bassi per quanto riguarda le infezioni dei cateteri vascolari e dei risultati meno buoni per le PAVM, illustrando la necessità di proseguire la ricerca in questo settore.	Le infezioni nosocomiali in rianimazione sono frequenti e possono essere gravi e la loro gravità dipende allo stesso tempo dall'infezione stessa e dall'alterazione dei meccanismi di difesa immunitaria del paziente, riflesso del suo terreno. Se i fattori che favoriscono la comparsa di una tale infezione sono numerosi, deve essere ottenuta una profilassi, anche se parziale, mediante l'utilizzo di misure semplici, fondate sul rigore dell'asepsi, sulla valutazione regolare della pertinenza dei dispositivi medici e sull'insegnamento, sulla valutazione e sull'informazione a proposito di questi elementi. Lo sviluppo di dispositivi associati a degli antisettici e/o a degli antibiotici potrebbe contribuire a una riduzione del rischio infettivo, in un certo numero di situazioni, in particolare nei pazienti più gravi.|

794	117e863766c98a05c65df685656ee17465ebddf9	Temporal and spatial characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state and city	From the first cases detected in Wuhan, China, of infections by the disease of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, until the present moment of this pandemic, millions of people have already been infected and hundreds of thousands have died worldwide. The way in which the virus has been dispersed in Brazil, and more specifically in Rio de Janeiro, is the motivation of the present work. Our studies consist of analyzing temporal and spatial characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in the municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro and in the neighborhoods of the state capital, based on open data published by the Health Departments of Governments of the State of RJ and the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, covering the period from February 27, 2020 to April 27, 2020. For that, we use analysis of time evolution graphs and mappings of spatial distributions and statistics analysis of spatial correlation. Our results suggest that the initial stages of spreading the virus across the state occur exponentially, with specific regions with a higher concentration of rates of cases, deaths and recovered people. In addition, our qualitative and quantitative results, for the data considered, point out that the regions with the highest income average per capita have higher rates of confirmed cases and recovered people, however, the regions of higher lethality do not are found in these places, with several of these regions of high lethality in places of low income per capita. Our results reinforce the idea of creating specific and strategic plans for policies to combat the spread of COVID-19 in the various localities in Rio de Janeiro.	New studies to assess future trends of rates of cases, deaths and recoveries for municipalities and neighborhoods can be direct consequences of this article. We expect the present work to contribute in the analyzes of creating specific strategic plans in municipalities (and even in the neighborhoods) for an effective and efficient fight against spread of the new coronavirus.|

We used unbiased sequencing methods for virus discovery in shorebird samples from the Delaware Bay, USA; an important feeding ground for thousands of migratory birds.	Our findings indicate the importance of surveying wild bird populations for circulating viruses; the discovery of novel shorebird CoV and AstV sequences in a small sample set demonstrates the potential diversity of novel avian viruses yet to be identified. The phylogenetic relation of sanderling AstV to ANV-1 may indicate a potential for interspecies transmission between wild birds and poultry also suggested by others [21, 22, 23, 24] . The CoV sequences reported here along with recent discoveries by others [28, 29] imply a vast diversity among circulating avian CoVs and a high prevalence in wild birds [28] . Finally, the Delaware Bay area could serve as a useful surveillance site for such novel avian viruses, in addition to influenza viruses. Due to the high volume of birds feeding during migration periods, the area may provide a niche for the emergence and spread of novel virus variants. |

The storage time of autologous blood is comparable to blood from other donors (up to 42 d with additive solutions). Unused autologous blood may be discarded or may be used for allogeneic transfusions in facilities that allow ""crossover"" only after infectious disease testing. Only 30% of collections are typically eligible for allogeneic use. Many institutions choose not to ""crossover"" autologous units because of the cost, complexity, and error risks associated with the process. Freezing and long-term storage of RBCs is indicated for patients with rare blood group antibodies, making it difficult to find compatible blood (see p.439).|"

We aimed to describe the patterns of new visits for a sore throat, complications and tonsillectomy during 2 years in a cohort of patients with pharyngotonsillitis and non-infected controls. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on a cohort of patients with acute sore throat (n = 207), and non-infected controls (n = 108). New visits, complications and tonsillectomy within 2 years was recorded and analyzed in relation to microbiological findings at inclusion. Results: Patients with Group A streptococci (GAS) (12/66) reconsulted more often within 30 days than patients with no GAS (9/141) (p = 0.009) and patients with F. necrophorum (2/29). After 2 years, we observed no significant differences in reconsultations with regard to aetiology at inclusion. A single complication was recorded and 5 patients were planned for tonsillectomy. Conclusions: Group A streptococci were the sole aetiological agent associated with recurrent sore throat while F. necrophorum did not distinguish itself as a major cause of either recurrent infection or complications in this cohort. More studies, preferably with the focus on adolescents, are needed before F. necrophorum can be considered an important cause of pharyngotonsillitis.	This study verifies that Group A Streptococci still is to be considered the most important pathogen in pharyngotonsillitis, associated with a higher number of new visits within 30 days, and that F. necrophorum did not distinguish itself as a major cause of recurrent infection or complications. These results do not merit any expansion of the aetiological paradigm of pharyngotonsillitis as suggested by others [20] . More studies, preferably treatment studies with the focus on the aetiology (and especially F. necrophorum) in adolescents with a sore throat, are needed before F. necrophorum can be confirmed or discarded as an important pathogen in pharyngotonsillitis.|

While SARS was sweeping over almost 30 countries, most hospitals in Taiwan instituted mandatory quarantine measures, one of the most effective public health strategies for preventing disease transmission. We explored the anti-SARS quarantine experience of patients in a hospital-based fever screening station. Methods: We conducted a phenomenologic, qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. Seventeen patients with fever who were quarantined in the fever screening station of a hospital emergency department for at least 2 hours were recruited into this study. Results: Data analysis using Collaizi's 9 steps revealed 2 categories-external burden and internal struggle-and 6 themes regarding patients' quarantine experience. External burden included 3 themes: (1) bearing the uncomfortable surroundings, (2) facing discrimination, and (3) lacking in-person family support. Internal struggle consisted of 3 themes: (1) struggle with being quarantined, (2) struggle with emotional turmoil, and (3) struggle with possible SARS diagnosis. Conclusion: These results will contribute to sensitizing health care professionals to empathize with quarantined persons while providing quality quarantine care and other infection control measures.	Although logistical dilemmas will always exist, we call on hospitals to reconsider and redesign their infection control systems and balance between implementing efficient and complete infection control and providing humanistic care. The results of our study may help sensitize health care professionals to empathize with quarantined persons while providing quality quarantine care and meeting specific needs related to the environment, education, emotional support, and stress management.|

To improve measles control strategy, the epidemic trend and population immunity of measles were investigated in 1951-2011 in Beijing. Methods: The changing trend of measles since 1951 was described based on measles surveillance data from Beijing Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The measles vaccination coverage and antibody level were assessed by routinely reported measles vaccination data and twenty-one sero-epidemiological surveys. Results: The incidence of measles has decreased significantly from 593.5/100,000 in 1951 (peaked at 2721.0/100,000 in 1955), to 0.5/100,000 in 2011 due to increasing vaccination coverage of 95%-99%. Incidence rebounded from 6.6/ 100,000 to 24.5/100,000 since 2005 and decreased after measles vaccine (MV) supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in 2010. Measles antibody positive rate was 85%-95% in most of years since 1981. High-risk districts were spotted in Chaoyang, Fengtai and Changping districts in recent 15 years. Age-specific incidence and proportion of measles varied over time. The most affected population were younger children of 1-4 years before 1978, older children of 5-14 years in 1978-1996, infant of <1 years and adults of ≥15 years in period of aim to measles elimination. Conclusion: Strategies at different stages had a prevailing effect on the epidemic dynamics of measles in recent 60 years in Beijing. It will be essential to validate reported vaccination coverage, improve vaccination coverage in adults and strengthen measles surveillance in the anticipated elimination campaign for measles.

Specimens were collected from 112 children with diarrhoea. The relative sensitivities of the different assays for human rotavirus were as follows: electron microscopy, 84%; immunofluorescence, 86 %; Rotalex, 88 %; Rotazyme, 89 %; immune electron microscopy, 93 %; Enzygnost, 98 %. According to our findings Enzygnost is the most sensitive method, but Rotalex is more valuable for screening a small number of faecal samples. No false-positive results were observed in the two enzyme immunoassays or in Rotalex.	of the antigenic subunit associated with the inner capsid of the virus, the site of the group antigen Common to all rotaviruses (24) . One sample that was positive in EM, IEM and IF was negative in the two ELISA procedures on two separate occasions. An explanation might be that rotavirus is covered by antibodies (25) and inhibitors are present in the faecal sample (26) . However, viruses that are morphologically indistinguishable from rotavirus but fail to react to ELISA have been detected in faecal samples from children with gastroenteritis in Washington (27) , Melbourne (28) and Paris (29) . Electrophoresis of the nucleic acid of one of these agents, which seem to lack the common group-specific antigen of rotaviruses, showed a unique migration pattern. Although a spectrophotometer was used for ELISA, results could be read visually with little difficulty. Nevertheless, these two sensitive methods also have disadvantages: the Rotazyme kit is expensive and Enzygnost is convenient only when large numbers of specimens must be assayed. In conclusion, our comparison of six methods for detecting HRV has shown that, considering all features (summarized in Table 3 ), Enzygnost is the most sensitive technique. However, Rotalex, a simple and rapid test, is more valuable for screening a small number of rotavirus isolates per day in laboratories with limited financial means.|

The amount of infectious virus recovered from the nine types of clothing decreased with time and was shown to differ widely between clothing samples, when the contaminated clothing samples were maintained in uncovered glass Petri dishes in a safety cabinet under air blowing. These results indicate a dependence of virus transmissibility on the nature of the contaminated clothes. The difference in recovery was shown to have no significant correlation with the thickness or the materials of the clothing; however, a correlation was observed with the residual amount of water in the deposited virus preparation on the test clothing.	Transmission of influenza virus is known to occur both directly and indirectly. The present study examined the recovery of influenza virus from experimentally virus-contaminated clothing, in order to understand the role of contaminated clothes in the transmission of influenza A virus during an epidemic period. Although the amount of infectious virus recovered from the contaminated clothes was mark-edly different between the clothing samples, the difference in recovery correlated with the residual amount of water in the deposited virus preparation on the test cloths. Considering that water from natural droplets would quickly evaporate once the droplet had fallen onto the clothes, indirect transmission of influenza through virus-contaminated clothing may occur, if only under limited circumstances. To understand the role of indirect transmission, further work is required; such as the study of the survival of viruses on contaminated hands and environmental surfaces, such as doorknobs and household furniture.|

However, rigorous studies correlating procalcitonin levels with microbiologic data are lacking. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) have been linked to viral and bacterial infection as well as noninfectious causes. Therefore, we evaluated procalcitonin as a predictor of viral versus bacterial infection in patients hospitalized with AECOPD with and without evidence of pneumonia. Methods: Adults hospitalized during the winter with symptoms consistent with AECOPD underwent extensive testing for viral, bacterial, and atypical pathogens. Serum procalcitonin levels were measured on day 1 (admission), day 2, and at one month. Clinical and laboratory features of subjects with viral and bacterial diagnoses were compared. Results: In total, 224 subjects with COPD were admitted for 240 respiratory illnesses. Of these, 56 had pneumonia and 184 had AECOPD alone. A microbiologic diagnosis was made in 76 (56%) of 134 illnesses with reliable bacteriology (26 viral infection, 29 bacterial infection, and 21 mixed viral bacterial infection). Mean procalcitonin levels were significantly higher in patients with pneumonia compared with AECOPD. However, discrimination between viral and bacterial infection using a 0.25 ng/mL threshold for bacterial infection in patients with AECOPD was poor. Conclusion: Procalcitonin is useful in COPD patients for alerting clinicians to invasive bacterial infections such as pneumonia but it does not distinguish bacterial from viral and noninfectious causes of AECOPD.	"In conclusion, we found that elevated serum procalcitonin levels are associated with more severe illness in patients hospitalized with symptoms of AECOPD and that high values may alert clinicians to the possibility of pneumonia. However, low procalcitonin values do not ""rule out"" bacterial infection in AECOPD. Before procalcitonin-based treatment algorithms are endorsed, additional studies in COPD patients should be performed. Clinical trials focusing on antibiotic |"

For this purpose, phosphorus maps (P-maps) have been obtained by applying the N-windows Eger~on model for background subtraction from data acquired by a non-dedicated TEM Jeol 1200EXII equipped with a post-column PEELS Gatan 666-9000 and a Gatan Image Filter (GIF-100). To prevent possible errors in the evaluation of elemental maps and thus incorrect nucleic acid localization, we have studied different regions of swine testis (ST) cells with similar local density containing either high concemration of nucleic acids (condensed chromatin and ribosomes) or a very low concentration (mitochondria). Special care was taken to optimize the sample preparation conditions to avoid as much as possible the traditional artifacts derived from this source. Selection of the best set of preedge images for background fitting was also considered in order to produce ""true P-maps"". A new software for interactive processing of images series has been applied to estimate this set. Multivariate Statistical Analysis was used as a filtering tool to separate the ""useful information"" present in the inelastic image series (characteristic signal) from the ""non-useful information"" (noise and aqquisition artifacts). The reconstitution of the original image series preserving mainly the useful information allowed the computation of P-maps with improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This methodology has been applied to study the RNA content of maturation intermediate coronavirus particles found inside infected cells."	The results presented here show that mapping nucleic acids in viruses is a biological problem that EFTEM can address, providing useful information on viral structure and morphogenesis. These results open up the possibility for further studies to follow the different steps involved in the RNA incorporation into viral particles during morphogenesis and the maturation processes involved. It is also clear that future improvements would demand an increment of the P detection sensitivity by enhancement of the SNR. We are presently carrying out several studies that could be useful to this end, such as the increment in the number of acquired images in the 105-155 eV range of energy loss, and the testing of other background models different from the Egerton power law.|

In our former work, the effects of the air cleaner on removing the uniformly distributed particles were numerically investigated. Based on those results, this work further explores the performances of the air cleaner in the reduction of two nonuniform particle distributions generated by smoking and coughing. The Lagrangian discrete trajectory model combined with the Eulerian fluid method is employed to simulate the airflow pattern and particle transport in a room. In general, the results show that the particle fates have been resulted from the interaction between the emitting source and the air cleaner. And the position of the air cleaner is a key parameter affecting the particle concentration, for which a shorter distance between the air cleaner and the human body corresponds to a lower concentration. Besides, the air velocity emitted from the human mouth and the orientation of the air cleaner can also influence the transport of particles.	For the coughing process, the lowest particle concentration is also achieved when the air cleaner is placed at the nearest position. However, due to the relatively higher velocity in coughing, the particles from the human mouth travel a longer distance. Moreover, when the air cleaner is placed opposite to the human, the particles of coughing tend to join the main flow of the circulating airflow of the air cleaner, and consequently may be removed by the air cleaner with higher possibility.|

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.	Our study suggests that the new corona virus (2019-nCoV) is not a mosaic and it is most closely related with the BatCoV RaTG13 detected in bats from Yunnan Province (Zhou et al., 2020) . The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. On the other hand, there is evidence for discordant phylogenetic relationships between 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 clade with their closest partners, the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. In accordance with previous analysis (http://virological.org/t/ncovs-relationship-to-batcoronaviruses-recombination-signals-no-snakes/331), Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences cluster in different positions in the tree, suggesting that they are recombinants, and thus that the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 are not (Ji et al., 2020; Magiorkinis et al., 2004) . One previous study based on codon usage analyses suggested that the spike protein of 2019-nCoV might have originated from one yet-unknown unsampled coronavirus through recombination (Ji et al., 2020) . Codon usage analyses can resolve the origin of proteins with deep ancestry and insufficient phylogenetic signal or invented de novo. The recently-published bat coronavirus sequence however provides strong phylogenetic information to resolve the origin of the Spike protein, as well as the rest of the genome, suggesting a uniform ancestry across the genome. We have previously shown that phylogenetic discordance in deep relationships of coronaviruses is common and can be explained either by ancient recombination event or altered evolutionary rates in different lineages, or a combination of both (Magiorkinis et al., 2004) . Our study rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event. Notably, the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. This genomic part comprises half of the spike region encoding a multifunctional protein responsible also for virus entry into host cells (Babcock et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005b) . The unique genetic features of 2019-nCoV and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans remain to be elucidated.|

Cytolysis requires interaction of the virus receptor and the viral S glycoprotein, is independent of other viral-induced components, and is not a unique property of B cells. Neutralizing anti-S-protein monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and a mAb specific for the viral receptor inhibit lysis. However, cells infected with an MHV strain unable to induce cell-cell fusion are resistant to lysis and lysis of JHMV-infected cells is inhibited by an anti-S-protein nonneutralizing mAb which prevents S-protein-mediated cell fusion. These data suggest that B cells may function as antibody-independent innate immune response during JHMV infection in vivo.

This class of compounds has enormous potential for application as an alternative to conventional antibiotics and for pest control. Understanding how LPs work from a structural and biophysical standpoint through investigating their interaction with cell membranes is crucial for the rational design of these biomolecules. Various analytical techniques have been developed for studying intramolecular interactions with high resolution. However, these tools have been barely exploited in lipopeptide-lipid interactions studies. These biophysical approaches would give precise insight on these interactions. Here, we reviewed these state-of-the-art analytical techniques. Knowledge at this level is indispensable for understanding LPs activity and particularly their potential specificity, which is relevant information for safe application. Additionally, the principle of each analytical technique is presented and the information acquired is discussed.

821	3c20c596797997337c0e8ed472cf7847dc467c65	Risk of MERS importation and onward transmission: a systematic review and analysis of cases reported to WHO	The continuing circulation of MERS in the Middle East makes the international dissemination of the disease a permanent threat. To inform risk assessment, we investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of MERS global dissemination and looked for factors explaining the heterogeneity observed in transmission events following importation. Methods: We reviewed imported MERS cases worldwide up to July 2015. We modelled importations in time based on air travel combined with incidence in Middle East. We used the detailed history of MERS case management after importation (time to hospitalization and isolation, number of hospitals visited,…) in logistic regression to identify risk factors for secondary transmission. We assessed changes in time to hospitalization and isolation in relation to collective and public health attention to the epidemic, measured by three indicators (Google Trends, ProMED-mail, Disease Outbreak News). Results: Modelled importation events were found to reproduce both the temporal and geographical structure of those observedthe Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and observed monthly time series was large (r = 0.78, p < 10 −4 ). The risk of secondary transmission following importation increased with the time to case isolation or death (OR = 1.7 p = 0.04) and more precisely with the duration of hospitalization (OR = 1.7, p = 0.02). The average daily number of secondary cases was 0.02 [0.0,0.12] in the community and 0.20 [0.03,9.0] in the hospital. Time from hospitalisation to isolation decreased in periods of high public health attention (2.33 ± 0.34 vs. 6.44 ± 0.97 days during baseline attention). Conclusions: Countries at risk of importation should focus their resources on strict infection control measures for the management of potential cases in healthcare settings and on prompt MERS cases identification. Individual and collective awareness are key to substantially improve such preparedness.	We evaluated the risk of MERS exportation worldwide integrating seasonal air traffic flows and time-varying incidence of cases in the affected area, and accounting for under-reporting of cases. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of all reported MERS imported cases to validate modelled importation risk and assess onward transmission. Our findings confirm the critical role of air travel in the risk of international dissemination. In case of MERS introduction, prompt identification of the infection in patients seeking medical attention, strict infection control measures, and effective isolation of the patient in the nosocomial setting are key to efficient prevention and control of the outbreak. Increasing awareness at collective and public health levels worldwide is found to be associated with higher local preparedness, prompter and strengthened precautionary measures and isolation procedures to prevent further spread. Our findings provide a quantitative assessment for public heath authorities to face the variability associated to importation risk and potential for local transmission, to inform preparedness plans, and identify the critical measures that should be considered to reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks.|

The construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here, providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates. Following transfection with the cDNA clone, infectious virus was rescued in both Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells. Recombinant MERS-CoVs (rMERS-CoVs) lacking the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were successfully rescued from cDNA clones with these genes deleted. The mutant viruses presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that accessory genes were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures. In contrast, an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural E protein (rMERS-CoV-⌬E) was not successfully rescued, since viral infectivity was lost at early passages. Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV-⌬E genome replicated after cDNA clone was transfected into cells.	Indirect immunofluorescence assay. Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells were grown to 80% confluence on glass coverslips and infected with the recombinant MERS-CoVs. At 48 h.p.i., cells were fixed either with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 20 min or with methanol at Ϫ20°C for 15 min. For N protein immunodetection, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% saponin in PBS containing 10% FBS for 20 min and incubated with MERS-CoV N protein pAb (dilution 1:200) in PBS containing 10% FBS at room temperature for 90 min. For E protein immunodetection, methanol-fixed cells were incubated with MERS-CoV E protein pAb (dilution 1:500) in PBS containing 10% FBS overnight at 4°C. Coverslips were washed 4 times with PBS and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 10% FBS. Nuclei were stained using DAPI (4=,6=-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1:200, Sigma). To fully inactivate the samples' infectivity, methanol-fixed cells were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS as described above. Finally, coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Images were acquired with the same instrument settings and analyzed with Leica software.|

824	5eb2d74678c3cb2191393365895f5d2ce88605fb			Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 binds with the ACE2 receptor for intracellular invasion, and the mechanism for acute lung injury during infection has been postulated to be mediated through activation of RAS. 5 In several studies, RAS blockade has been proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19 (figure). 6 Angiotensin 2 (AT2) primarily activates the type 1 angiotensin 2 receptor (AT1R), which potentially mediates pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and oedema. 7 ACE2 activation results in low amounts of AT2 and increased production of the anti-inflammatory heptapeptide angiotensin(1-7). Impaired ACE2 activity results in excessive amounts of AT2, allowing for unopposed activation of AT1R and subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 5, 8 Fang and colleagues postulate that patients with SARS-CoV-2 treated with ARBs and ACEIs are at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection because of a potential upregulation of ACE2. However, preclinical models of SARS-CoV infection do not support this hypothesis. In 2005, Kuba and colleagues 8 found that mice treated with losartan after acid aspirationinduced acute lung injury (with addition of SARS-CoV spike protein) had significantly diminished lung injury and pulmonary oedema compared with mice treated with placebo. 8 Furthermore, recombinant human ACE2 infusions or losartan both prevented severe lung injury and pulmonary oedema in ACE2-knockout mice. 9 Administration of recombinant human ACE2 improved lung injury in patients with SARS-CoV infection and in acid aspiration and sepsis-induced models of ARDS. 8, 9 This premise supports the initiation of randomised controlled trials assessing recombinant human ACE2 infusions and losartan in patients with COVID-19. Severe ARDS secondary to impaired ACE2 activity has been identified in other viral pneumonias (eg, H5N1 and H7N9 influenza). 10 Treatment of mice after infection with H5N1 influenza with losartan versus placebo was associated with reduced pulmonary oedema, pulmonary neutrophil infiltration, and significantly improved survival. 10 Although controversy exists about the role of RAS inhibition in COVID-19, no evidence is available to support routine discontinuation of ACEIs or ARBs. Preclinical evidence suggests that RAS blockade might attenuate progression of COVID-19. We argue that clinical equipoise exists and, before the medical community makes recommendations for patients to withhold potentially life-saving drugs, there is a critical and urgent need for multicentre trials to test this hypothesis in patients with COVID-19. |

Over the past few months, there is a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to coronavirus infection. It has been observed that elderly individuals and those with medical co-morbidities are maximally affected. In children and adolescents, coronavirus infection has low mortality as well as the severity of symptoms are less. Children and adolescents with immunocompromised state, malnutrition, medical co-morbidities and poor hygiene are at higher risk of contracting coronavirus infection. Minimizing this risk factors and adopting appropriate prevention measures will be helpful in limiting the spread of infection as there is no specific treatment and immunization available to date to address this serious issue. This chapter highlights the issues and challenges of coronavirus infection in children and adolescents.	• Children and adolescents with coronavirus infection have milder symptoms. • Compromised immune function, malnutrition, co-morbid medical illnesses and poor hygiene are potential risk factors for contracting coronavirus infection in children and adolescents. • Social distancing, limiting group activities, play time, tours, picnics and adequate hygiene training may be beneficial in limiting the chances of getting coronavirus infection in children and adolescents.|

The need for IgG-IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG-IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG/IgM test kit and RT-PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild/common and severe/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3.

We employed 17 PCR assays and retrospectively screened 315 specimens selected by season from a predominantly pediatric hospital-based population. Before the Brisbane respiratory virus research study commenced, one or more predominantly viral pathogens had been detected in 15.2% (n ¼ 48) of all specimens. The Brisbane study made an additional 206 viral detections, resulting in the identification of a microbe in 67.0% of specimens. After our study, the majority of microbes detected were RNA viruses (89.9%). Overall, human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target (n ¼ 140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n ¼ 25), human metapneumovirus (HMPV; n ¼ 18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n ¼ 15), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n ¼ 12), human coronaviruses (HCoVs; n ¼ 11), and human herpesvirus-6 (n ¼ 11). HRVs were the sole microbe detected in 37.8% (n ¼ 31) of patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Genotyping of the HRV VP4/VP2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into sublineages A1 and A2. Most of the genotyped HAdV strains were found to be type C. This study describes the high microbial burden imposed by HRVs, HMPV, HRSV, HCoVs, and the newly identified virus, HBoV on a predominantly paediatric hospital population with suspected acute respiratory tract infections and proposes a new formulation of viral targets for future diagnostic research studies.

We have observed that PSGs induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), which among its other diverse functions inhibits T-cell function and has proangiogenic properties. The present study investigates a potential role for PSG1, the most abundant PSG in maternal serum, as a possible inducer of proangiogenic growth factors known to play an important role in establishment of the vasculature at the maternal-fetal interface. To this end, we measured TGFB1, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) A and C, and placental growth factor (PGF) protein levels in several cell types after PSG1 treatment. In addition, tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to investigate a possible direct interaction between PSG1 and endothelial cells. PSG1 induced up-regulation of both TGFB1 and VEGFA in human monocytes, macrophages, and two human extravillous trophoblast cell lines. We did not observe induction of VEGFC or PGF by PSG1 in any of the cells tested. PSG1 treatment resulted in endothelial tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to map the essential regions within the N-domain of PSG1 required for functional activity. We found that the aspartic acid at position 95, previously believed to be required for binding of PSGs to cells, is not required for PSG1 activity but that the amino acids implicated in the formation of a salt bridge within the N-domain are essential for PSG1 function.	In the present study, we show that different cell types can respond to PSG1, secreting growth factors known to regulate vascular development and trophoblast behavior. In addition, the in vitro studies described here indicate that the interaction of PSG1 with endothelial cells can have functional consequences. Therefore, we propose that besides their ability to regulate the immune response, PSGs may have the previously unrecognized ability to contribute to the establishment of the vasculature during pregnancy. The precise processes during angiogenesis in the maternal-fetal unit that could be modulated by this family of proteins require further investigation.|
830	056674c9a5177fe8457d69b236ed805d90858904	Dynamic Pattern Mining: An Incremental Data Clustering Approach	We propose a mining framework that supports the identification of useful patterns based on incremental data clustering. Given the popularity of Web news services, we focus our attention on news streams mining. News articles are retrieved from Web news services, and processed by data mining tools to produce useful higher-level knowledge, which is stored in a content description database. Instead of interacting with a Web news service directly, by exploiting the knowledge in the database, an information delivery agent can present an answer in response to a user request. A key challenging issue within news repository management is the high rate of document insertion. To address this problem, we present a sophisticated incremental hierarchical document clustering algorithm using a neighborhood search. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is the ability to identify meaningful patterns (e.g., news events, and news topics) while reducing the amount of computations by maintaining cluster structure incrementally. In addition, to overcome the lack of topical relations in conceptual ontologies, we propose a topic ontology learning framework that utilizes the obtained document hierarchy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm produces high-quality clusters, and a topic ontology provides interpretations of news topics at different levels of abstraction.	We presented the mining framework that is vital to intelligent information retrieval. An experimental prototype has been developed, implemented and tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In order to accommodate topics that change over time, we developed the incremental document clustering algorithm based on a neighborhood search. The presented clustering algorithm could identify news event clusters as well as topic clusters incrementally. We also showed that presented topic ontologies could characterize news topics at multiple levels of abstraction. We intend to extend this work into the following five directions. First, although a document hierarchy can be obtained using unsupervised clustering, as shown in Aggarwal et al. [1] , the cluster quality can be enhanced if a preexisting knowledge base is exploited. That is, based on this priori knowledge, we can have some control while building a document hierarchy. Second, besides exploiting text data, we can utilize other information since Web news articles are composed of text, hyperlinks, and multimedia data. For example, as described in [25] , both terms and hyperlinks (which point to related news articles or Web pages) can be used for feature selection. Third, coupling with WordNet [36] , we plan to extend the topic ontology learning framework to accommodating rich semantic information extraction. To this end, we will annotate a topic ontology within Protégé [38, 54] . Forth, our clustering algorithm can be tested on other datasets like TDT corpus [53] . Finally, to strengthen our work in terms of generality, we are in the process of investigating the potential applicability of our method to earth science information streams.|

Early-life respiratory virus infections have also been shown to be associated with adverse long-term consequences.	CONCLUSION Respiratory viral infections are not uncommon among neonates treated in NICUs. Given the significant burden of respiratory virus infections among this highly susceptible population, and the limited prevention tools that are available, a focus on appreciating and containing the consequences of these infections is warranted. It can be recommended that any infant with signs of infection should also be suspected of having a respiratory virus infection. Simple flocked nasal swabs and multiplex PCR tests are recommended as diagnostic methods. Furthermore, all available preventive and curative modalities against viral respiratory tract infections during the neonatal period should be implemented. Preventing nosocomial virus infections by using intensified hygiene measures and cohorting infected infants should be a major goal in NICUs. Further research, active virus surveillance and long-term follow-up are also needed to ascertain the causality and the exact underlying mechanisms for adverse long-term consequences.|

Cytopathicity was attributed to different amino acid substitutions at the same critical env residue involved in receptor interaction: S82F in the Moloney variant Spl574, and S84A in the Friend mouse leukemia virus F-S MLV. Because M. dunni cells carry a variant CAT-1 cell surface virus receptor (dCAT-1), we examined the role of this receptor variant in cytopathicity and host range.	To screen for the formation of multinucleated syncytium in virus infected cells, 2 × 10 4 cells in six-well tissue culture plates or 10 5 cells in 60 mm plates were infected with virus-containing medium in the presence of 4 ug/ml polybrene. After 2-4 days, the cells were examined by light microscopy using objective lenses of 4×-20× and photo-|

Consumers can now access online bookings for airlines, accommodation, transportation, sightseeing tours and other related products, so why do they still go to travel agencies for reservations? This article identifies the attributes consumers seek in a travel agency or consultant and determines the relative importance of these in their selection process. The research was conducted in two stages. The first stage was a series of in-depth interviews with 10 travel agency users and three travel consultants.	This study investigated only the Darling Downs region in Queensland, Australia, and therefore the findings could not be generalised to the population at large. A more representative sampling population should be sought to generalise the findings and be tested in another Australian regional setting. The findings from this study could be further investigated in a business organisation context where comparisons to the findings could be made to determine if there are any significant differences between individual consumers and business organisations on the factors influencing the selection of travel agencies in regional settings. Furthermore, the attitude of customers who do not walk through the door (example via the internet) could also be explored, to determine if any differences existed between traditional 'walk in' customers and 'techno savvy' customers who generally make online bookings, when selecting travel agencies.|

First, we suggest a set of generic scientific concepts that have been identified in a systematic annotation process. This set of concepts is utilised to annotate a corpus of scientific abstracts from 10 domains of Science, Technology and Medicine at the phrasal level in a joint effort with domain experts. The resulting dataset is used in a set of benchmark experiments to (a) provide baseline performance for this task, (b) examine the transferability of concepts between domains. Second, we present a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline. Further, we propose the active learning strategy for an optimal selection of instances from among the various domains in our data. The experimental results show that (1) a substantial agreement is achievable by non-experts after consultation with domain experts, (2) the baseline system achieves a fairly high F1 score, (3) active learning enables us to nearly halve the amount of required training data.	Furthermore, we have suggested active learning for our novel task. We have shown that only approx. 5 annotated abstracts per domain serving as training data are sufficient to build a performant model. Our active learning results for SciERC [32] and ScienceIE17 [2] datasets were similar. The promising results suggest that we do not need a large annotated dataset for scientific information extraction. Active learning can significantly save annotation costs and enable fast adaptation to new domains.|

Further animal experimental results showed that rAd-PEDV-S elicited a significant PEDV-specific humoral immune response after vaccination (P < 0.05). In addition, rAd-PEDV-S provided partial protection for pigs against the highly virulent PEDV challenge. e results presented in this study indicate that the adenovirus vector can be used as a vaccine delivery vector for the development of a PEDV vaccine and is a promising novel vaccine candidate for future prevention and control of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), but its efficacy still needs to be improved in the future.	e authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. Pigs were challenged orally with 2 mL of 1 × 10 5 TCID 50 highly virulent genotype GIIb PEDV strain. Dpi: days post inoculation for pigs; NP: number of PEDV-positive piglets; CT: cycle threshold value-a value greater than 30 was considered negative or below the detection limit of real-time PCR; CS: clinical score for fecal consistency-0 � normal, 1 � pasty, 2 � semiliquid, and 3 � liquid; -: samples with no CT value (no PEDV RNA detected). e blocks without any entry indicate that the PEDV-positive piglets were euthanized after infection was confirmed by clinical symptoms and fecal viral shedding.|

PCR or RT-PCR was used to screen for the presence of 10 respiratory viruses. Viral agents were identified in 73.92% (601/813) of specimens, including RSV in 40.71%, hMPV in 6.15%, IFVA in 7.13%, IFVB in 0.98%, PIV1-3 in 7.87%, HCoV-HKU1 in 2.21%, HCoV-NL63 in 3.81%, HRV in 19.93%, AdV in 7.50% and HBoV in 11.56%. Two or more viruses were detected in 34.44% (280/813) of cases. The newly identified respiratory viruses, HBoV, hMPV, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63, accounted for 22.01% of the detected viral pathogens. RSV and HRV were frequently detected in patients with bronchiolitis, and hMPV was frequently associated with pneumonia. HCoV-NL63 was found to be one of the causative agents of acute respiratory wheezing in young children. No seasonal variation was found in the incidence of detection of HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 or HBoV. This 3-year study demonstrated that viral pathogens play an important role in children with ALRTIs, and more attention should be paid to these newly identified viral agents.	As ALRTIs cause a high disease burden in China, strengthening research into the pathogens that cause these infections is very important in developing new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. This 3-year study demonstrated that at least threequarters of ALRTIs in children were associated with known viral pathogens. RSV and HRV were the two most common viruses detected. Novel viral agents, including HBoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and hMPV, accounted for a high proportion of ALRTIs. More attention should therefore be paid to these agents. Additional study is required to define the exact role and molecular and epidemiological characteristics of these newly identified viral agents in ALRTIs in different geographical regions.|
838	ce7edbd492820594a19c88eb4c617fb3052dd380	Increased risk of hepatitis E virus infection in schizophrenia	Until now, the risk of HEV infection in schizophrenia was unknown. The present results showed that the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG and anti-HEV IgM in schizophrenia were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Anti-HEV IgG positivity increased with age and with the duration of disease in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, schizophrenia patients with increased CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell ratios ([2.03) had higher anti-HEV IgG detection rates than those with normal ratios (1.05-2.03). Compared with the schizophrenia patients who tested anti-HEV IgG negative, the levels of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 (Th2 cytokines) were significantly higher, while the interleukin-12 (Th1 cytokine) level was significantly lower, in those with anti-HEV IgG positivity. Of five schizophrenia patients who were anti-HEV IgM positive, four had elevated CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell ratios. HEV RNA was isolated from one of these four patients and classified as genotype 4. Anti-HEV IgM positivity was not detected among healthy controls. Therefore, schizophrenia patients exhibited a higher risk of HEV infection than controls.	The major implication of this study is that there may be more potential risk factors in schizophrenia patients, which may be responsible for the increased transmission of HEV. Also, there are several limitations in our present study. First, the various drugs used in schizophrenia may affect the immune system, and virtually all our schizophrenia patients were on this type of medication. Relationships between drugs and immune bias, and the effect of this relationship on the risk of HEV infection in schizophrenia should be assessed in the future. Second, we did not include inflammatory markers other than serum IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-c, and thus, future work should be carefully interpreted in the light of this. Third, larger numbers of schizophrenia patients and controls as well as long-term follow-up will be required to further analyze the increased risk of HEV infection in schizophrenia. Taken together, schizophrenia patients exhibited higher risk of HEV infection than controls in the present study. Anti-HEV IgG seropositivity increased with age and with the duration of illness. Moreover, schizophrenia patients with increased CD4 ? /CD8 ? T-cell ratios had higher anti-HEV IgG detection rates than those with normal ratios. The levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly higher, while the IL-12 level was significantly lower in schizophrenia patients with anti-HEV IgG positivity than in those who were antibody negative. In order to understand the questions behind the observed associations, further work is needed, with larger samples and longitudinal follow-ups.|

Here, we review recent reports of nucleoside analogues that exhibit broad-spectrum activity towards multiple life-threatening RNA and DNA viruses. We also present a discussion about nucleoside antimetabolites-approved antineoplastic agents-that have recently been shown to have antiviral and/or antibacterial activity. The approved drugs and drug combinations, as well as recently identified candidates for investigation and/or experimentation, are discussed. Several examples of repurposed drugs that have already been approved for use are presented. This strategy can be crucial for the first-line treatment of acute infections or coinfections and for the management of drug-resistant strains.	Even though more than 90 antiviral drugs are currently approved for the treatment of viral infections, many of them are suitable for use only with a single virus. New antiviral drugs with activity against multiple viral types are being sought, and many of these compounds are subjects of advanced clinical trials. Moreover, experimental data open the possibility of repurposing broad-spectrum antimetabolites to other viral infections. Because these drugs have already been approved, such an application could save the time and money that are needed to prove their safety. It is possible that a compound that has already been classified as a drug against one virus may be suitable for the treatment of other viral infections. This approach is particularly important for candidates for the treatment of deadly viral infections, such as Ebola virus (EBOV). In this case, the safety threshold would be based on different criteria from those that are currently applied for drugs used to control chronic infections such as HIV and HBV.|

841	4f080de581c8fa26ec5f8ac311d707fb4fbafc1e	EXPOSURE		Reducing reliance on safety signals is also an important component of exposure. Clients may need to work on practicing exposure to healthrelated situations without carrying their medication, water bottle, cell phone or other anxiety-reducing device. It is important for the clinician to review the use of safety behaviors occasionally through the course of treatment and to help the client gradually eliminate the use of excessive safety behaviors. As is the case with checking and reassurance seeking, it is important to establish what is realistic and appropriate (e.g., having a first aid kit in the home and car) and what is not (e.g., staying within a certain distance of a hospital or doctor's office). CONCLUSION For many clients, avoidance is a core feature of their health anxiety. Exposure to bodily symptoms and themes of illness and death is, therefore, critical for treatment success. In vivo, imaginal, and interoceptive exposure can all be helpful techniques, depending on the nature of the avoided stimuli. We encourage gradual and repeated exposure to feared health-related situations. Our experience has been that introducing these strategies early in treatment can result in substantial reductions of avoidance and anxiety.|

We assume that the reproduction is asexual, and that the mutations can be described by a linear integral operator. We are interested in the interplay between the time variable t and the rate ε of mutations. We show that depending on α > 0, the limit ε → 0 with t = ε −α can lead to population number densities which are either Gaussian-like (when α is small) or Cauchy-like (when α is large).	or|

These data may help providers to make decisions about therapeutic care, particularly as more inexpensive viral diagnostic tests become available. Finally, as attempts to develop a vaccine or antiviral therapy for HMPV are currently under way, the identification of risk factors for infection and for severe disease is crucial to identify groups that would benefit most from these advances, and to help develop focused prevention strategies.|
844	225b622abc3a9d620cff32ffb50d0033472a2cf4	Molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium parvum from two different Japanese prefectures, Okinawa and Hokkaido	Infectious diarrhea is the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal calves. Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the main pathogens associated with calf diarrhea. Although diarrhea is a symptom of infection with various pathogens, investigations to detect the types of pathogens have never been performed in Japan. This study investigated the prevalence of four major diarrhea-causing pathogens in calves: C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli K99). Commercial immunochromatography testing of all four pathogens and molecular analysis of C. parvum with diarrhea in calves from southernmost Okinawa and northernmost Hokkaido, Japan, were conducted. The frequencies of C. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and E. coli (K99) in Okinawa were 50%, 28%, 2.3%, and 4.7%, respectively. Watery fecal stools were significantly correlated with C. parvum (p b 0.05). In oocyst calculations for C. parvum, no significant difference was observed between the single-infection cases and the mixed-infection cases with rotavirus. Interestingly, molecular analyses targeting small subunit ribosomal RNA as well as glycoprotein 60 (GP60) genes revealed that the C. parvum nucleotide sequences from the two prefectures were identical, indicating that C. parvum with a uniform characteristic is distributed throughout Japan. GP60 subtyping analysis identified C. parvum from Okinawa and Hokkaido as belonging to the IIaA15G2R1 subtype, a known zoonotic subtype. Hence, control of cryptosporidiosis is important not only for pre-weaned calves, but also for human health.	Many C. parvum subtypes are categorized as the IIa subtype family on the basis of their worldwide GP60 sequences [11, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Interestingly, the GP60 nucleotide sequences detected from the two different locations were identical to each other, and were classified as the IIaA15G2R1 subtype. Furthermore, previous analyses of the GP60 subtype of C. parvum from Gifu, Kobe, Hokkaido, and the most recent epidemiological study performed in the Ishikari district of Hokkaido also reported the occurrence of the IIaA15G2R1 subtype alone [14, 17, 37] . These findings suggest that C. parvum with the IIaA15G2R1 subtype is predominant in Japan. Because IIaA15G2R1 is a zoonotic subtype [10] , cryptosporidiosis control in Japan is important for the health of domestic ruminants and humans alike.|

The FIVpositive cats were divided into 3 groups: group I included asymptomatic carriers; group II comprised sick FIV-infected cats with illnesses not likely to influence the hemostatic system; and group 111 included FIV-positive cats with diseases potentially associated with coagulopathies. Platelet counts in FIV/FeLV-infected cats were significantly lower than in healthy cats (P < ,003). whereas the differences in the 3 groups of FIV-positive cats were variable (group 1, P = .009; II, P = .05; 111. P = .OS). Thrombocytopenia (445,000 plateletslpl) was present in 4 FIVpositive and 3 FIV/FeLV-positive cats. Platelet aggregation induced by collagen (0.5 and 0.25 pg/mL), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ( I and 0.6 pmol/L), and thrombin (0.4 and 0.25 IU/mL) was not significantly different from that of healthy cats. The plasma coagulation system was evaluated by measuring one-stage prothrombin time (OSPT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time, fibrinogen concentration, coagulation factor assays, fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products (FDP), and plasma exchange test. The OSPT was similar in FIV-seropositive cats and in the healthy control group. Cats with FIV infection, however, had markedly shorter clotting times than healthy cats when using a modified test system emostatic disorders can occur in the course of different H viral infections in cats.'-6 Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline panleucopenia virus infections.

847	8d662aaab4afda6c43bd35603ff87e190854de90	Experimental hypersensitivity pneumonitis: Role of MCP-1	"Inhalation of Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula causes ""farmer's lung"" disease, a classic example of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice challenged with S rectivirgula, and S rectivirgula induces MCP-1 secretion by alveolar macrophages. We tested the hypothesis that MCP-1 and its receptor CC chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) are essential to the development of experimental HP by treating mice with MCP-1 antibody and using CCR2 ؊/؊ mice. Administration of anti-MCP-1 did not change the response to intratracheally administered S rectivirgula. CCR2 ؊/؊ animals responded in a fashion similar to that of wild-type animals to intratracheally administered.S rectivirgula. To determine the influence of the MCP-1-CCR2 interaction in vitro, we transferred S rectivirgula-cultured spleen cells from S rectivirgulasensitized mice, to naïve recipients. Later, challenge of the recipients with intratracheal S rectivirgula and examination of both lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid characteristics were used to determine whether adoptive transfer had occurred. We found that cultured cells from CCR2 ؊/؊ animals were fully capable of adoptive transfer. We conclude that interaction of MCP-1 with CCR2 is not necessary for the development of pulmonary inflammation in response to intratracheally administered S rectivirgula or cells able to adoptively transfer experimental HP.

By carrying out the bifurcation analysis of the model, we show that there exist some values of the model parameters such that numerous kinds of bifurcation occur for the model, such as Hopf bifurcation, Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation.	Epidemic mathematical models have become important tools to study the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases in host populations. There have been lots of works on the stability of endemic equilibrium for some epidemic models (cf. [10] [11] [12] and references therein). In this paper, we have studied the bifurcation behaviors of the SIR epidemic model with the general non-monotone and nonlinear incidence rate kIS/(1 + bI + aI 2 ). From the analysis, we have found that there exist some values of the model such that the model can undergo a series of bifurcations, such as saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. When a stable limit cycle surrounds the endemic equilibrium, it means that the number of the infective tends to a periodic function and the disease will exhibit frequently regular oscillation. Hence, the disease become periodic outbreak as time evolves. On the other hand, there exist some parameters values such that the model has two endemic equilibria (one is a saddle and the other is centertype equilibrium) and a stable homoclinic loop. Thus, the disease will persist.|

The method makes use of the microcantilevers of an atomic force microscope onto which monoclonal antibodies against avian influenza virus were covalently immobilized. The factors influencing the performance of the resulting immunosensors were optimized by measuring the deflections of the cantilever via optical reflection, and this resulted in low detection limits and a wide analytical range. The differential deflection signals revealed specific antigen binding and their intensity is proportional to the logarithm of the concentrations of the virus in solution. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensors exhibit a linear response in the 7.6 ng mL −1 to 76 μg mL −1 concentration range of avian influenza virus, and the detection limit is 1.9 ng mL −1 .	We have taken advantage of bio-chemically induced surface stress to directly and specifically transduce molecular recognition into nano-mechanical responses in a microcantilever sensor to successfully detect AIV. This is achieved by immobilizing antibodies on one side of the cantilever and then detecting the mechanical bending induced by antigen-antibody specific binding in a liquid environment. A major advantage of this type of direct transduction is elimination of external optical displacement measurement systems and the requirement that the molecules under investigation be labeled, for example, with fluorescence or radioactive tags. The microcantilever system can provide a low cost, high sensitivity, high throughput, and attractive alternative platform for pathogen detection in the future. This work should broaden applications of microcantilever-based biosensors for pathogen detection and enable the possible future use of such biosensors in medicine, agriculture, food safety, and environmental monitoring.|

To prevent recurrence of a similar situation, we should not only seek to improve and strengthen such systems and measures, but also to develop trained experts and proper facilities. In addition, the outbreak raised several research questions on the epidemiology, virology, pathogenesis, infection control, and treatment of MERS-CoV infection that await answering. Research into the Korean outbreak will provide valuable lessons for better global public health. |

In addition, the unaltered version of the engineered plant may be a food or feed crop, or neither. Expression may involve transgene(s) vehiculation into nuclear or organelle genome resulting in protein monomers, multimers or virus-like particles. The PMP may be intended for purification, or administration as a crude extract or whole-plant tissue with a route of administration may be parenteral oral, nasal or topical. All these aspects may emphasize the advantages of the plant-based system but also influence the steps toward the commercialization process. The aim of molecular farming is to produce large quantities of active and secure cost-effective pharmaceutical proteins. These approaches, in comparison with other established microbial and animal expression systems, show various advantages in the biosynthesis of pharmaceutical biomolecules. So far, lots of valuable pharmaceutical proteins and antibodies have been produced by this method, which can help the treatment of patients remarkably in developing countries where the production and preservation costs of such medicines cannot be afforded. However, there are still some disputes, such as the acceptance by the general public and the biosecurity hurdles. On the other end, it is astonishing to consider that a technology that began with the hypothesis that the plant cells could behave as a reactor for newly induced biosynthesis has actually resulted in lifesaving treatments like in the case of Z-Mapp and Elelyso. The recent past has seen the emergence of PMP-based companies and the beginning of commercial era of PMP products. The success of Protalix Biotherapeutics and Medicago (just to name one of the expanding companies in the field) and many others will probably sustain the future of the PMP field. Looking ahead, the progress of further products to market and the gaining of a wider acceptance of the biopharmaceutical industry are hoped.|
853	35280a72bb06b25d4a02e38efd412e97a40883c5		A new hepatitis E virus (HEV-7) was recently found in dromedaries and 1 human from the United Arab Emirates. We screened 2,438 dromedary samples from Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and 4 African countries. HEV-7 is long established, diversified and geographically widespread. Dromedaries may constitute a neglected source of zoonotic HEV infections.	The human HEV seroprevalence in the Middle East region might in fact be caused by HEV-7 infection. Furthermore, human HEV-7 infections might contribute to the HEV prevalence in all studied areas, where camel products are frequent parts of human diet (15) . A foodborne transmission scenario is further suggested by the fact that 1 of 12 positive serum in the study was actually sampled in a slaughterhouse, documenting that meat from infected animals can enter the food chain (6) . Detections of HEV-7 RNA in feces in this and a previous study (2) point at feces or feces-contaminated camel products, such as milk, as putative additional sources of human infection. Considering the importance of dromedaries as livestock animals (15) , risk groups, such as slaughterhouse workers, should be screened for HEV-7 infection. Orthohepevirus C (GenBank accession no.

856	ea2599631be33cfe3ad2e7c0c48273a6048e8ddd	The Involvement of Natural Killer Cells in the Pathogenesis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome	By using peripheral blood samples from 221 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 34 of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, and 44 healthy adults, we measured the total number of natural killer (NK) and CD158b+ NK cells (CD158b+ NK) using flow cytometric analysis and calculated the percentage of CD158b+ NK cells. The total number of NK and CD158b+ NK cells and the percentage of CD158b+ NK cells were significantly lower in patients with SARS than in those with M pneumoniae infection (P < .05 for all) and healthy subjects (P < .01, P < .01, P < .05, respectively); in 72 patients with severe SARS than in 149 with mild SARS (P < .05 for all); and in 174 cases of SARS with anti-SARS coronavirus-specific IgG and/or IgM antibodies than in 47 without antibodies (P < .05, P < .01, P < .01, respectively). There were no significant differences for the 3 values among patients with SARS without anti-SARS coronavirus antibody, patients with M pneumoniae infection, and healthy subjects. The number of NK cells and the expression of CD158b on the surface of NK cells changed in patients with SARS and correlated with disease severity and the presence of anti-SARS coronavirus-specific antibodies; SARS differed from M pneumoniae infection in pathogenesis involving NK cells. Monitoring the total number of NK and CD158b+ NK cells and the percentage of CD158b+ NK cells might aid in differentiating SARS from M pneumoniae infection.	"Unlike the SARS cases, there was little change in the number of NK cells and CD158b+ NK cells and the percentage of CD158b+ NK cells in patients with M pneumoniae infection, which indicates that the NK cells have different roles in the 2 diseases. Although the difference in the number of NK cells and CD158b+ NK cells and the percentage of CD158b+ NK cells between patients with mild SARS and patients with M pneumoniae infection did not reach statistical significance (almost 30% of mild SARS cases were negative for anti-SARS coronavirus-specific antibodies), the cell counts and percentages in antibody-positive SARS cases (which might be considered ""true"" SARS cases) were significantly lower than those in cases of M pneumoniae infection and clinically diagnosed, antibody-negative cases of SARS (which might be considered ""false"" SARS). Therefore, monitoring the number and percentage of NK cells should be useful for differentiating true SARS from false SARS and M pneumoniae infection.|"

Group II :had balanced general anesthesia. Measurements: 1-Number of neonates required post operative ventillatory support in both groups. 2-Mean total dose of opioids required for analgesia in both groups. 3-Days of stay in NICU in both groups. 4-Mortality in both groups RESULTS: 1-There was statistically significant less need for ventilatory support in group I (16%) in comparison to group II (41 %). 2-Mean total dose of opioid analgesia was higher in group II 3-More days of stay in group II. 4-Three cases of mortality in group II ,while one case of mortality in group I. CONCLUSION: Picu mortality was relative high, partly due to high PRISM scores and the high proportion of MV pts. Mortality continues to increase up to 1y and stayed the same thereafter. The majority of our pts reached their preadmission cognitive status (PCPC) at two y. On the other hand they didn't reach their overall functional status (POPC) even after two y mainly due to the high proportion of pts with mild disability, POPC 2, which is however compatible with near normal and independent life.|

In ten children rotavirus was found in the faeces and the bacteriological findings were negative, Rotavirus particles were aggregated by convalescent child sera and by normal human gamma globulin. The clinical picture was characterized by the sudden onset of vomiting and fever, in one case with febrile convulsions. Diarrhoea was watery and yellow-green, and usually persisted for four to five days. The condition of the children improved rapidly after rehydratation and a special diet. Older siblings, and in one family also adult members, were frequently affected. Zusammenfassung: Rotaviren-Gastroenteritis bei Siiuglingen und Kleinkindern. Wiihrend des Frfihjahres 1977 wurden in der Infektionsklinik in Prag elektronenoptische Untersuchungen yon Stuhlsuspensionen bei 18 Siiuglingen und Kleinkindern durchgefiihrt. Die epidemioloischen Angaben wiesen keinen Verdacht auf Salmonellosen, Shigellosen oder Coli-Infektionen auf. In zehn F~illen wurden Rotaviren nachgewiesen. Die bakteriologischen Befunde waren bei allen Kindern negativ. Rotavirus-Partikel wurden mit Kinder-Rekonvaleszentenserum und auch mit normalem humanem Gammaglobulin aggregiert. Ffir das klinische Bild waren pl6tzlicher Ausbruch mit Erbrechen und Fieber, in einem Fail mit febrilen Kriimpfen charakteristisch. Die Diarrh6e war w~isserig, gelbgriin und dauerte meistens 4 bis 5 Tage. Nach Rehydratation und Dfiit-Magnahmen erholten sich die Kinder rasch. Oft erkrankten auch die iilteren Geschwister der Kinder und in einem Fall auch die erwachsenen Familienmitglieder.	The absence of bacterial pathogenic agents and the aggregation of rotavirus particles by convalescent stage sera of sick children suggest an aetiopathogenetic role of rotavirus in these diseases. On the basis of our initial immunoelectronmicroscopic findings and the incidence of antibodies in normal gamma globulin, we assume that rotaviruses also play a significant role in the aetiology of diarrhoea in infants and young children in Czechoslovakia, in particular during the cold season.|

Despite a global commitment to the use and sharing of public health data, this can be challenging in reality. No systematic framework or global operational guidelines have been created for data sharing in public health. Barriers at different levels have limited data sharing but have only been anecdotally discussed or in the context of specific case studies. Incomplete systematic evidence on the scope and variety of these barriers has limited opportunities to maximize the value and use of public health data for science and policy. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of potential barriers to public health data sharing. Documents that described barriers to sharing of routinely collected public health data were eligible for inclusion and reviewed independently by a team of experts. We grouped identified barriers in a taxonomy for a focused international dialogue on solutions.	WGvP contributed to study design, the literature review and wrote the manuscript.

La diversité des microbes ne peut se comprendre qu'au sein d'une biodiversité tout aussi vaste d'hôtes vertébrés, mais également invertébrés, champignons, végétaux, espèces et individus. Une notion intéressante et importante actuellement débattue est celle du « rôle » possible de cette double biodiversité, parasites au sens large et hôtes, dans la « dilution » des souches pathogènes, ce qui se traduirait par un effet positif de cette même biodiversité sur la santé à l'échelle de la planète [32 et voir aussi 33 pour une lecture critique]. D'une part, le rythme actuel d'érosion de la biodiversité est tel que si jamais cette hypothèse avait un certain fondement, elle ne pourrait être démontrée qu'a contrario, ce qui représenterait une bien maigre consolation. D'autre part, imaginer que l'espèce humaine serait extérieure aux écosystèmes qu'elle habite au point de ne pas agir sur les cycles épidémiologiques qu'elle y croise serait irresponsable.

NIKULA	1988) Toxicol. AppI. Pharmacol. 93,[394][395][396][397][398][399][400][401][402]. Adaptation to prolonged ozone (Or) exposure occurs in the tracheal epithelium of rats and is marked by the presence ofciliated cells with uniform short cilia but is not accompanied by shifts in cell populations, altered characteristics of epithelial secretory cell products, increased cell turnover, or elevated tracheal superoxide dismutase activity. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of alterations intrinsic to epithelial cells or to the cells and their matrix, and not due to systemic or neural influences. Rats were preexposed to either filtered air (FA) or 0.96 ppm O3 for 8 hr/night for 60 days, and then their tracheae were removed and exposed to 3 ppm O3 in an explant culture system where behavioral, nasal, exudative, and secretory product influences can be eliminated. After exposure to 3 ppm 0, in vitro, quantitative electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the epithelia from the FA preexposure group had significantly more necrotic cells and sloughed cells and fewer ciliated cells than the epithelia from the Or preexposure group. Thus previous exposure to ozone in vivo induces a change in tracheal epithelium which confers resistance to ozone-induced injury in the explant exposure system.	Among the various tracheobronchial cell types, ciliated cells are commonly considered the most sensitive to ozone-induced injury (Dungworth et al., 1975; Menzel, 1984) , and the cell membrane is a major target for ozone-induced injury (Menzel, 1984) either due to oxidation of membrane lipids (Menzel, 1970) , proteins (Mudd and Freeman, 1977) , or due to the formation of free radicals either directly or indirectly through lipid peroxidation (Pryor et a/. , 198 3) . The most striking change in the rat tracheal epithelium induced by 60 days of ozone exposure in vivo was the presence of ciliated cells with uniform short cilia (Nikula d al., 1988) . If the number of cilia per cell did not increase, then these altered ciliated cells may represent an adaptive decrease in surface area per ciliated cell. The cellular adaptation could also be due to enhanced antioxidant mechanisms, particu- Ratio of abnormal ciliated cells/total ciliated cells.

Glutathione (GSH) has been shown to be important in the defense of cultured alveolar type II cells (A549 cell-line) against the toxic action of ozone during short-term (2.5 hr) exposures (Rietjens et al., 1985) . In rats exposed to O3 for several days, increased activities of lung GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase, and glucosed-phosphate (G-6-P) dehydrogenase have been observed, leading to the proposal that the increased activity of GSH peroxidase catabolizes lipid peroxides formed during ozone exposure, while the increased activities of GSH reductase and G-6-P dehydrogenase provide increased levels of GSH and NADPH, respectively (Chow and Tappel, 1972) . The association between the short cilia, which are the morphologic correlate of tracheal adaptation to ozone exposure, and the antioxidant enzyme systems and perhaps alterations in the glycocalyx or matrix need to be further explored.|

In this rapidly developing field of study, interdisciplinary and challenging research, performed in both industrialized and resource-limited countries, can bring critically important information for life and social sciences, for public health, and for health care overall. The aim of this special issue is to contribute to the development of knowledge on emerging infection in the endless warfare between viruses and man. However, the articles included in this volume are not representative of the whole field of emerging infections, since they have been selected with the aim of presenting a point of view on uncovered issues or providing insights on key/hot topics for which scientific knowledge is rapidly evolving knowledge. Thus, our intention was not to conduct a systematic collection of all emerging infections, but to address specific issues that may be important in order to understand why and when a new agent may emerge, and how we may intervene in an effective way. We hope we succeeded, at least in part, in this difficult task.|

We drive two processes to analyze COVID-19 data considering measures, and then forecasting is done for Senegal. We show a comparison between deterministic and two machine learning technics for forecasting.	In this paper, we have analyzed the impact of anti-pandemic measures in Senegal. First, we used techniques of fitting function to the data of the total number of cases. The choice of the data fit function is crucial for the results since it allows the estimation of the parameters of the compartmental model used. In a second work, we used neural networks to also predict the future evolution of the pandemic in Senegal. Also, we were able to integrate the effects of the measures into the prediction. Depending on the measures taken, the pandemic's trajectory may become slower or lose its exponential nature. It would be interesting, in the following, to use other functions of a slow nature like the logistical function to fit data and thus obtain different results. A stochastic study using Brownian motions applied to the SIRU compartmental model would also be interesting.|

A striking example is the recurrent outbreaks that have been occurring in seabirds on Amsterdam Island for the past 30 years, threatening populations of three Endangered seabird species and of the endemic, Critically Endangered Amsterdam albatross Diomedea amsterdamensis. The bacteria Pasteurella multocida (avian cholera causative agent), and to a lesser extent Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (erysipelas causative agent), were both suspected to be responsible for these epidemics. Despite this critical situation, demographic trends were not available for these threatened populations, and the occurrence and characterization of potential causative agents of epizootics remain poorly known. The aims of the current study were to (i) provide an update of population trends for four threatened seabird species monitored on Amsterdam Island, (ii) assess the occurrence of P. multocida, and E. rhusiopathiae in live birds from five species, (iii) search for other infectious agents in these samples and, (iv) isolate and genotype the causative agent(s) of epizooties from dead birds. Our study shows that the demographic situation has worsened substantially in three seabird species during the past decade, with extremely low reproductive success and declining populations for Indian yellow-nosed albatrosses Thalassarche carteri, sooty albatrosses Phoebetria fusca, and northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi. Pasteurella multocida or E. rhusiopathiae were detected by PCR in live birds of all five investigated species, while results were negative for eight additional infectious agents. A single strain of P. multocida was repeatedly cultured from dead birds, while no E. rhusiopathiae could be isolated. These results highlight the significance of P. multocida in this particular eco-epidemiological system as the main agent responsible for epizootics. The study stresses the urgent need to implement mitigation measures to alter the course of avian PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197291 May 30, 2018 1 / 17 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Jaeger A, Lebarbenchon C, Bourret V, Bastien M, Lagadec E, Thiebot J-B, et al.

If brown rats were identified as a major reservoir, then a control of this invasive species would be expected to have a major positive impact on seabird population dynamics [62] . In addition, P. multocida isolates obtained herein allowed the development of an experimental vaccine, the efficacy of which was evaluated in a controlled study [63] . Any mitigation measure should be eventually included within a proactive strategy aiming at controlling disease outbreaks whose demographic consequences threaten the persistence of seabirds on Amsterdam Island, including flagship species such as albatrosses.|

By induction on k and Proposition 5.1, if x p,k is in the image of the Thom map T , then so is x p,k+1 = P p k (x p,k ).

In spite of this high medical relevance, neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy is currently available. DENV elicits a strong interferon (IFN) response in infected cells, but at the same time actively counteracts IFN production and signaling. Although the kinetics of activation of this innate antiviral defense and the timing of viral counteraction critically determine the magnitude of infection and thus disease, quantitative and kinetic analyses are lacking and it remains poorly understood how DENV spreads in IFN-competent cell systems. To dissect the dynamics of replication versus antiviral defense at the single cell level, we generated a fully viable reporter DENV and host cells with authentic reporters for IFN-stimulated antiviral genes. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner that at the single cell level is highly heterogeneous and stochastic. Even at high-dose, IFN does not fully protect all cells in the culture and, therefore, viral spread occurs even in the face of antiviral protection of naïve cells by IFN. By contrast, a vaccine candidate DENV mutant, which lacks 2'-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. Through mathematical modeling of time-resolved data and validation experiments we show that the primary determinant for attenuation is the accelerated kinetics of IFN production. This rapid induction triggered by mutant DENV precedes establishment of IFN-resistance in infected cells, thus causing a massive reduction of virus production rate. In contrast, accelerated protection of naïve cells by paracrine IFN action has negligible impact. In conclusion, these results show that attenuation of the 2'-O-PLOS Pathogens | Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a global health problem for which no selective therapy or vaccine exists. The magnitude of infection critically depends on the induction kinetics of the interferon (IFN) response and the kinetics of viral countermeasures. Here we established a novel live cell imaging system to dissect the dynamics of this interplay. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner. At the single cell level, the IFN response is highly heterogeneous and stochastic, likely accounting for viral spread in the presence of IFN. Mathematical modeling and validation experiments show that the kinetics of activation of the IFN response critically determines control of virus replication and spread. A vaccine candidate DENV mutant lacking 2'-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. This attenuation is primarily due to accelerated kinetics of IFN production acting on infected cells in an autocrine manner. In contrast, accelerated protection of naïve cells by paracrine IFN action has negligible impact. Thus, attenuation of the 2'-O-methylation DENV mutant is primarily determined by kinetics of autocrine IFN action on infected cells.

Such approaches have allowed rapid diagnosis with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. However, conventional PCR methods have several intrinsic disadvantages such as the requirement for temperature cycling apparatus, and sophisticated and costly analytical equipments. Therefore, amplification at a constant temperature is an attractive alternative method to avoid these requirements. A new generation of isothermal amplification techniques are gaining a wide popularity as diagnostic tools due to their simple operation, rapid reaction and easy detection. The main isothermal methods reviewed here include loopmediated isothermal amplification, nucleic acid sequencebased amplification, and helicase-dependent amplification. In this review, design criteria, potential of amplification, and application of these alternative molecular tests will be discussed and compared to conventional NAATs.	Step 4 Fig. 3 Amplification scheme of HDA method. (Step 1) DNA helicase unwinds doublestranded DNA. ( Step 2) SSB proteins stabilize the displaced DNA strands. ( Step 3) Specific primers hybridize to the ssDNA template and are extended by DNA polymerase. (Step 4) A double-stranded copy of the DNA target is produced HDA and gold nanoparticle probes. Andresen et al. [97] incorporated HDA on a microarray for quantitative detection of antibiotic-resistant pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus. Microfluidic chips have also been developed for HDA at 62°C for quantification of SARS cDNA [98] . A fully integrated microfluidic device for DNA extraction and HDA at 65°C on samples containing live bacteria has been developed by Mahalanabis et al. [99] . This microfluidic device was the first to combine bacterial lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and DNA amplification on the same chip. Finally, Kivlehan et al. [100] reported for the first time the utilization of a quantitative electrochemical method to monitor in real-time the HDA of nucleic acids in less than 1 h at a single constant temperature. The principle of detection consists of monitoring a decrease in the electrochemical current response of a reporter probe during the amplification process. The detection strategy is analogous to that of real-time HDA assay. However, this innovative electrochemical method offers some advantages compared to conventional realtime assays being potentially more robust, simpler, and less expensive. Isothermal HDA kits are currently available and commercially developed at BioHelix (Beverly, MA, USA). In conclusion, it is expected that more useful and simpler isothermal amplification techniques will be invented to be used for the detection of different pathogens.|

The clinical course was punctuated by spontaneous remissions and relapse. There were two striking physical findings, weak withdrawal reflexes and atrophy of the proximal and distal limb muscles. Electrophysiological findings typical of a demyelinating motor neuropathy were present, namely small, dispersed compound muscle action potentials, markedly slow motor conduction and denervation potentials that were more prominent distally. Muscle biopsies showed changes consistent with denervation and a paucity of myelinated axons in intramuscular nerve bundles. The neuropathy responded rapidly and completely to prednisolone administration, which was slowly tapered over several months.	The similarities between the present case and the report of Shores and others (1987) suggest that cats with muscle atrophy and limb weakness which remits and relapses might be suspected of having a chronic relapsing polyneuropathy. Pursuing a diagnosis via electrophysiological testing and, or, nerve biopsy is advisable, as glucocorticoid therapy would appear to be rewarding, at least in some cases.|
878	160ecaaa5a766c289fc2f6b5499f0dfe7aab971c	Stochastic discrete epidemic modeling of COVID-19 transmission in the Province of Shaanxi incorporating public health intervention and case importation	"Before the lock-down of Wuhan/Hubei/China, on January 23 rd 2020, a large number of individuals infected by COVID-19 moved from the epicenter Wuhan and the Hubei province due to the Spring Festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the Shaanxi province. The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xi'an. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of ""resumption of work"", show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10 th and February 4 th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation."

Increased use of wild lands for crops has resulted in significant losses in biodiversity, or ecosystem simplification. Virus disease emergence in crops is a complex process that involves interactions among wild and domestic hosts, insect and other virus vectors, and changes in ecosystems. Although the data is quite limited, evidence to date indicates that loss of biodiversity will lead to increased incidence of virus disease. The need for more studies on the presence of viruses in wild and domestic plants, particularly without regard to symptoms, is apparent, and a thorough understanding of these dynamic processes will not be possible until more data are available. In addition, the role of crop viruses in diseases of wild plants is largely unknown. Spillover from domestic plants to wild plants could contribute to increased simplification of wild ecosystems, further increasing the potential for newly emerging diseases in crops. |

A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of 2019-nCoV is lacking, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development. In this study, we predicted the potential of all the 2019-nCoV viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and form linear antibody epitopes. We showed that the enrichment for T cell and B cell epitopes is not uniform on the viral genome, with several focused regions that generate abundant epitopes and may be more targetable. We showed that genetic variations in 2019-nCoV, though fewer for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus, which should be considered in the development of therapies. We create an online database to broadly share our research outcome. Overall, we present an immunological resource for 2019-nCoV that could significantly promote both therapeutic development and mechanistic research.

GLA loaded PLGA nanoparticles were prepared with different drug to polymer ratios, acetone contents and sonication times and the antibacterial activity of the developed nanoparticles was examined against different gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The antibacterial effect was studied using serial dilution technique to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of nanoparticles. Results demonstrated that physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were affected by the above mentioned parameters where nanoscale size particles ranging from 175 to 212 nm were achieved. The highest encapsulation efficiency (53.2 ± 2.4%) was obtained when the ratio of drug to polymer was 1:4. Zeta potential of the developed nanoparticles was fairly negative (-11±1.5). In-vitro release profile of nanoparticles showed two phases: an initial phase of burst release for 10 h followed by a slow release pattern up to the end. The antimicrobial results revealed that the nanoparticles were more effective than pure GLA against P. aeuroginosa, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. This improvement in antibacterial activity of GLA loaded nanoparticles when compared to pure GLA may be related to higher nanoparticles penetration into infected cells and a higher amount of GLA delivery in its site of action. Herein, it was shown that GLA loaded PLGA nanoparticles displayed appropriate physicochemical properties as well as an improved antimicrobial effect.	GLA loaded PLGA nanoparticles were successfully prepared with an appropriate size and zeta potential. The antimicrobial activity evaluation showed that NPs were more effective than pure GLA against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeroginosa. It can be proposed that the clinical activity of GLA can be enhanced if a GLA nanoparticle formulation is used and this allows for a more efficient therapy compared to the conventional formulation of free antibiotics present in the market. |

Using molecular analysis supplemented by available epidemiologic data, we identified MERS-CoV transmission within a large health care facility and demonstrated the feasibility and value of complete viral genome sequence analysis in outbreak investigations. We showed that what was seemingly a contiguous outbreak within KFMC was caused by multiple introductions of virus from outside the hospital. The small number of mutations observed across the 29,897-nt genome analyzed during this outbreak emphasizes the need for complete genome analysis if molecular epidemiology is to be meaningful in such settings. The ongoing outbreak of MERS in South Korea (2), the largest cluster of transmission from a returning traveler to date, highlights the ongoing threat from MERS and the need for understanding pathways of transmission. Detailed molecular epidemiology can contribute to these efforts and thus help minimize transmission.|

The EMBO Journal VOL 24 | NO 12 | 2005 EMBO THE EMBO JOURNAL THE EMBO JOURNAL	As the P22 tail machine shows preferential orientation in ice, we took micrographs by tilting the grids by angles of 0, 20, 30, 40 and Figure 7 Fourier shell correlation plots of reconstructions of (A) the truncated P22 portal and (B) the P22 tail machine. In (B), the Fourier shell correlation drops to 0.5 at 1/23 Å À1 , 0.4 at 1/22 Å À1 , and 0.3 at 1/16 Å À1 . 601. Inspection of the tilt series assisted manual building of an initial model by addition of six cylindrical density and a small spherical density to the portal reconstruction. In this initial model, one end of the cylindrical density was in close proximity to the lower part of the wing domain of the portal and the other end was slightly pointed outward so that the long axes of the cylinders and the portal channel form an angle of 151. The small spherical density was placed next to the bottom opening of the portal. An initial data set of 3087 particles was used to calculate a preliminary reconstruction, which gave rise to an elongated needle-like density for the originally spherical one and therefore served as a validation for the reconstruction. A total of 17 517 particles were boxed from tilted micrographs into a 160 Â160 dimension with a pixel size of 4.2 Å . A reconstruction was calculated and refined using all the data and imposing C6 symmetry. In order to avoid possible inaccuracy in the length of the gp26 needle arising from saturated density in top or bottom views, the particles from untilted micrographs were excluded from the reconstruction. The gp26 needle in the reconstruction computed from all data was removed. With such an initial model and 11 329 particles from tilted micrographs, a new reconstruction was calculated and refined. The contrast transfer functions were not corrected. The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated to be 23 Å , where the Fourier shell correlation for two independent reconstructions calculated from half data sets started to drop to 0.5 ( Figure 7B ) (van Heel et al, 2000) .

Here, a strategy to facilitate manipulation and rescue of classical swine fever viruses (CSFVs) from full-length cDNAs present within bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) is described. This strategy allows manipulation of viral cDNA by targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis within bacteria. Results: A new CSFV-BAC (pBeloR26) derived from the Riems vaccine strain has been constructed and subsequently modified in the E2 coding sequence, using the targeted recombination strategy to enable rescue of chimeric pestiviruses (vR26_E2gif and vR26_TAV) with potential as new marker vaccine candidates. Sequencing of the BACs revealed a high genetic stability during passages within bacteria. The complete genome sequences of rescued viruses, after extensive passages in mammalian cells showed that modifications in the E2 protein coding sequence were stably maintained. A single amino acid substitution (D3431G) in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase was observed in the rescued viruses vR26_E2gif and vR26, which was reversion to the parental Riems sequence.

However, only a few experimentally supported lncRNA-protein associations have been reported. Existing network-based methods are typically focused on intrinsic features of lncRNA and protein but ignore the information implicit in the topologies of biological networks associated with lncRNAs. Considering the limitations in previous methods, we propose PLPIHS, an effective computational method for Predicting lncRNA-Protein Interactions using HeteSim Scores. PLPIHS uses the HeteSim measure to calculate the relatedness score for each lncRNA-protein pair in the heterogeneous network, which consists of lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein association network and protein-protein interaction network. An SVM classifier to predict lncRNA-protein interactions is built with the HeteSim scores. The results show that PLPIHS performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves an AUC score of 0.97 in the leave-one-out validation test. We also compare the performances of networks with different connectivity density and find that PLPIHS performs well across all the networks. Furthermore, we use the proposed method to identify the related proteins for lncRNA MALAT1. Highlyranked proteins are verified by the biological studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.	The PLPIHS framework is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Firstly, we construct a heterogeneous network consisting of a lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, a lncRNA-protein association network and a protein-protein interaction network. Three kinds of sparse networks are obtained from the heterogeneous network under different cutoff value 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 (see lncRNA-Protein associations). The larger cutoff is, the network is more sparse. A total of 15941 lncRNAs genes and 20284 protein-coding genes are extracted as presented in Section 2.3. We randomly take out 1511 lncRNAs and 344 proteins to construct a smaller network for the following experiments in consideration of computing costs. The construction of the smaller heterogeneous networks under different cutoff values are shown in Table 4 , where 'lnc2lnc' denotes the lncRNA-lncRNA network, 'lnc2code' denotes the lncRNA-protein network and 'code2code' denotes the protein-lncRNA network. Table 1 . We use id to indicate the path combination, i.e., 1′~2′ represents path 'LLP' and path 'LPP' . Next, we calculate the heteSim score for each lncRNA-protein pair under each path. The results of different paths are used as different features. And we combine a constant factor β to inhibit the influence of longer paths.The longer the path length is, the smaller the inhibiting factor is. Finally, a SVM classifier is built with these scores to predict potential lncRNA-protein associations. On the account of the HeteSim measure is based on the path-based relevance framework 39 , it can effectively dig out the subtle semantics of each paths. |

Microvascularepithelial exudation of bulk plasma proteins characteristically occurs in asthmatic patients, being especially pronounced in those with severe and exacerbating asthma. Healthy human and guinea pig airways challenged by noninjurious histamineleukotriene-type autacoids also respond through prompt mucosal exudation of nonsieved plasma macromolecules. Contrary to current beliefs, epithelial permeability in the opposite direction (ie, absorption of inhaled molecules) has not been increased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis or in acutely exuding healthy airways. A slightly increased subepithelial hydrostatic pressure produces such unidirectional outward perviousness to macromolecules. Lack of increased absorption permeability in asthmatic patients can further be reconciled with occurrence of epithelial shedding, leaving small patches of denuded basement membrane. Counteracting escalating barrier breaks, plasma exudation promptly covers the denuded patches. Here it creates and sustains a biologically active barrier involving a neutrophil-rich, fibrin-fibronectin net. Furthermore, in the plasma-derived milieu, all epithelial cell types bordering the denuded patch dedifferentiate and migrate from all sides to cover the denuded basement membrane. However, this speedy epithelial regeneration can come at a cost. Guinea pig in vivo studies demonstrate that patches of epithelial denudation regeneration are exudation hot spots evoking asthma-like features, including recruitment/activation of granulocytes, proliferation of fibrocytes/smooth muscle cells, and basement membrane thickening. In conclusion, nonsieved plasma macromolecules can operate on the intact airway mucosa as potent components of first-line innate immunity responses. Exuded plasma also takes center stage in epithelial regeneration. When exaggerated, epithelial regeneration can contribute to the inception and development of asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2019;143:1271-86.)	d We need to define in detail several additional features of plasma exudation in asthma, as summed up by the following questions: To what extent does plasma exudation actually occur? Is there an exudative hyperresponsiveness to challenge with microvascular permeability agents? To what extent does exuded plasma contribute to airway plugs? What is the relative contribution of cell-derived versus plasma-derived proteins in asthmatic patients, including coagulation and complement molecules? On that note, is plasma exudation an ''all-in'' defense/disease mechanism or are there conditions when individual plasma protein systems are selectively activated? d Plasma exudation in response to asthma-like epithelial denudation is distinguished by means of sustained occurrence, providing both physical and biological protection. We need to know what plasma-derived molecules are essential for epithelial regeneration and whether any cell-derived molecule is also essential in this process in vivo. We need to know the extent of patchiness of epithelial denudation and how we can define such hot spots in asthmatic patients. How do inflammatory and remodeling responses evoked by epithelial regeneration events fare compared with other such mechanisms in vivo at asthma inception, asthma development, and asthma exacerbation?|

There are widespread reports of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), which are paramount to protect frontline medical/nursing staff and to minimize further spread of the virus. We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing evidence on SARS-CoV-2 survivorship and methods to disinfect PPE gear, particularly N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR). In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, we focused on the sister virus SARS-CoV-1. We propose a two-step disinfection process, which is conservative in the absence of robust evidence on SARS-CoV-2. This disinfection protocol is based on an initial storage of PPE for ≥4 days, followed by ultraviolet light (UVC), dry heat treatment, or chemical disinfection. Importantly, each of the two steps is based on independent disinfection mechanisms, so that our proposed protocol is a multiplicative system, maximising the efficacy of our disinfection process. This method could be rapidly implemented in other healthcare settings, while testing of each method is undertaken, increasing the frontline supply of PPE, and avoiding many of the upstream issues of supply chain disruption currently being faced.	• The lowest applied dose tested of 120 J/cm 2 reduced the bursting strength of the four models tests by 11% to 42% (depending on layer and model). |

Die Langzeitprognose, insbesondere bei neonatalem Beginn, geht jedoch weiterhin mit einer hohen Mortalitätsrate sowie mit der Entwicklung neurologischer Defizite einher. In den letzten Jahren etablierte sich international die Lebertransplantation als eine erfolgreiche Therapieoption. Bei transplantierten Patienten zeigte sich eine Verbesserung des neurologischen Outcome und der Lebensqualität. Die kumulative 5-Jahres-Überlebensrate beträgt derzeit über 90%. Von den seit April 2003 durch das österreichische Neugeborenenscreening identifizierten Patienten mit erhöhter Zitrullinkonzentration im Trockenblut präsentierte sich nur 1 Patient mit dem klassischen neonatalen Beginn. Vor Erhalt des Screeningergebnisses kam es am 4. Lebenstag zu einer milden Hyperammonämie von 590 µmol/l bei einer Zitrullinkonzentration im Plasma von 2384 µmol/l (Ref. <35). Unmittelbar nach Diagnosestellung wurde den Eltern die Möglichkeit einer Leber-bzw. Leberzelltransplantation vorgeschlagen. Trotz guter Therapiecompliance kam es rezidivierend zu metabolischen Krisen wodurch mehrmalige stationäre Aufenthalte erforderlich waren. Im Alter von 8 Monaten erfolgte die Listung zur orthotopen Lebertransplantation welche im Alter von 13 Monaten komplikationslos durchgeführt werden konnte. Innerhalb von 3 Wochen kam es zu einer akuten Abstoßungsreaktion welche jedoch mit Umstellung der immunsuppressiven Therapie sowie Cortison-Stoßtherapie gut behandelt werden konnte. Seit der Lebertransplantation kam es zu keinen weiteren metabolischen Krisen, die Zitrullinkonzentration im Plasma ist 2 Tage danach um die Hälfte abgefallen und beträgt aktuell 306 µmol/l.

Some of these diseases spread quickly within ranks resulting in large outbreaks, and personnel deployed are also often immunologically naïve to otherwise uncommonly-encountered pathogens. Furthermore, the chance of weaponised biological agents being used in conventional warfare or otherwise remains a very real, albeit often veiled, threat. However, such challenges also provide opportunities for the advancement of preventive and therapeutic military medicine, some of which have been later adopted in civilian settings. Some of these include improved surveillance, new vaccines and drugs, better public health interventions and inter-agency co-operations. The legacy of successes in dealing with infectious diseases is a reminder of the importance in sustaining efforts aimed at ensuring a safer environment for both military and the community at large.

They represent also an important economic burden to health systems worldwide. However, a large proportion of HAI are preventable through effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. Improvements in IPC at the national and facility level are critical for the successful containment of antimicrobial resistance and the prevention of HAI, including outbreaks of highly transmissible diseases through high quality care within the context of universal health coverage. Given the limited availability of IPC evidencebased guidance and standards, the World Health Organization (WHO) decided to prioritize the development of global recommendations on the core components of effective IPC programmes both at the national and acute health care facility level, based on systematic literature reviews and expert consensus. The aim of the guideline development process was to identify the evidence and evaluate its quality, consider patient values and preferences, resource implications, and the feasibility and acceptability of the recommendations. As a result, 11 recommendations and three good practice statements are presented here, including a summary of the supporting evidence, and form the substance of a new WHO IPC guideline.

Currently, there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 based on large clinical trial data, and hence, management involves infection prevention and control measures and supportive care. With anecdotal reports and in vitro studies suggesting that certain medicines already in use for treatment of other conditions could be viable treatment options, there has been an increased demand for these therapies which could have adverse consequences on patients and healthcare systems. Toxicity from these medicines resulting from a mad rush for them at community pharmacies and pressure on physicians to prescribe for individuals who do not have the infection are worth noting. Furthermore, the indiscriminate use of these medicines could result in viral resistance as well as acute shortage such that patients who routinely take them for other conditions may not get them.	In conclusion, as COVID-19 continues to spread and efforts are being made to flatten the infection curve, the general population must be monitored and educated on indiscriminate medication use in an attempt to prevent the virus from infecting human hosts. They must be made aware that current medicines are served on prescription basis at hospitals and COVID-19 isolation and treatment centers and are not for COVID-19 prevention. Rather, they must be educated on approved methods of preventing the spread of the virus recommended by the WHO. In spite of the global panic to quickly resolve the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists must be vigilant and ensure rational medicine use while repurposing old remedies.|

Contributions which endure usually lose connection with their originators. J. B. S. Haldane drew attention to the point by saying that the discoveries of which he was most proud were those which had passed into the public lore, so that they were no longer given any citation in the literature, and their authorship was, therefore, lost to view. By that, of course, he was referring to their broad importance and universal acceptance. This is now happening to the painstakingly detailed and precise nutritional balance studies of Gordon, Levine, and others, upon which infant nutrition as we know it now is squarely based.

Emergency department (ED) clinicians are at high risk of exposure to both these and common communicable diseases. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended to protect clinicians from acquiring, or becoming vectors of, infection, yet compliance is typically sub-optimal. Little is known about factors that influence use of PPE-specifically gloves and masks-during routine care in the ED. Methods: This was an ethnographic study, incorporating documentation review, field observations and interviews. The theoretical domains framework (TDF) was used to aid thematic analysis and identify relevant enablers of and barriers to optimal PPE use. Results: Thirty-one behavioural themes were identified that influenced participants' use of masks and gloves. There were significant differences, namely: more reported enablers of glove use vs more barriers to mask use. Reasons included more positive unit culture towards glove use, and lower perception of risk via facial contamination. Conclusion: Emerging infectious diseases, spread (among other routes) by respiratory droplets, have caused global outbreaks. Emergency clinicians should ensure that, as with gloves, the use of masks is incorporated into routine cares where appropriate. Further research which examines items of PPE independently is warranted. (R. Barratt).

This self-assembling protein nanoparticle contains five CD8 + HLA-A03-11 supertypes-restricted epitopes from antigens expressed during Toxoplasma gondii's lifecycle, the universal CD4 + T cell epitope PADRE, and flagellin as a scaffold and TLR5 agonist. These CD8 + T cell epitopes were separated by N/KAAA spacers and optimized for proteasomal cleavage. Self-assembling protein nanoparticle adjuvanted with TLR4 ligand-emulsion GLA-SE were evaluated for their efficacy in inducing IFN-γ responses and protection of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against T. gondii. Immunization, using self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE, activated CD8 + T cells to produce IFN-γ. Self-assembling protein nanoparticle-GLA-SE also protected HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice against subsequent challenge with Type II parasites. Hence, combining CD8 + T cell-eliciting peptides and PADRE into a multi-epitope protein that forms a nanoparticle, administered with GLA-SE, leads to efficient presentation by major histocompatibility complex Class I and II molecules. Furthermore, these results suggest that activation of TLR4 and TLR5 could be useful for development of vaccines that elicit T cells to prevent toxoplasmosis in humans.

Dabei beschränken wir uns im klinischen Alltag nicht nur auf die von der ILLCOR empfohlene Indikation, sondern setzten die Hypothermie großzügig auch bei Pat. mit Asystolie und nach Reanimation im Krankenhaus ein. Mit den folgenden Daten sollen unsere Ergebnisse und Erfahrungen mit der therapeutischen Hypothermie dargestellt werden. Methode: In einer retrospektiven Analyse untersuchten wir 81 Patienten (17 Frauen, 64 Männer, mittleres Alter 59,3 Jahre), die wegen anhaltender Bewusstlosigkeit nach CPR über 24 h mit therapeutischer Hypothermie behandelt wurden und verglichen diese mit den Daten von 41 Patienten (12 Frauen, 29 Männer, mittleres Alter 63,8 Jahre), die eine Standardtherapie ohne Hypothermie erhielten. Alle Patienten mussten mindestens 48 h überleben. Bei Pat. die eine Hypothermiebehandlung erhielten wurde vor Kühlbeginn ein Aufwachversuch von 45 bis 60 Min. Dauer durchgeführt. Um eine Negativauswahl bei den Patienten mit Standardtherapie ausschließen zu können, wurden nur Patienten in die Auswertung eingeschlossen, welche die gleichen (erweiterten) Einschlusskriterien wie die Hypothermiepatienten erfüllten. Ergebnisse: Von 81 Hypothermiepatienten verstarben 33 (41%), 48 überlebten (59%). In der Standardtherapiegruppe verstarben lediglich 10 Pat. (24%, p = 0,074), 31 überlebten (76%). In dieser Gruppe überlebten signifikant mehr Pat. mit einem GOS von 3-5 als in der Hypothermiegruppe (68% vs. 48%, p = 0,035). In der Hypothermiegruppe wurden signifikant mehr Pat. prähospital reanimiert, 65% vs. 39% in der Standardtherapiegruppe. Bei Pat. mit Kammerflimmern verstarben in der Hypothermiegruppe 16 (31%), in der Standardtherapiegruppe 3 (12%, p = 0,062) und bei Pat. mit Asystolie verstarben 17 (59%) vs. 6 (40%, p = 0,24). Pat. die in der Hypothermiegruppe mit einem GOS von 3-5 überlebten (n = 39) waren signifikant jünger (53,5 vs. 64,7 Jahre, p = 0,006) als Pat. die verstarben oder apallisch (GOS 1 + 2) wurden. Außerdem war in dieser Gruppe Kammerflimmern mit 77% vs. 52% signifikant häufiger (p = 0,021) und der SAPS II lag mit im Mittel 52,2 signifikant niedriger als bei Pat. mit GOS 1 + 2 mit 63,4 (p = 0,006). Bei Pat. mit einem GOS von 3-5 lag die Körpertemperatur während der Behandlung im Mittel 21 h im Zielbereich von 32,5-33,5 8C während Pat. mit GOS 1 + 2 im Mittel nur 12,6 h im Zielbereich lagen. Dieser Unterschied war signifikant (p < 0,001). Andere Parameter wie Hypoxiezeit (p = 0,053), Anteil prähospitaler Reanimation (p = 0,49), Latenz zwischen ROSC und Kühlbeginn (p = 0,99), Latenz zwischen ROSC und Erreichen der Zieltemperatur (p = 0,81), Gesamtdauer der Kühlung (p = 0,65) und Kühlmethode (extern vs. intravasal, p = 1) zeigten keine signifikanten Unterschiede.

To this end, a large number of peptide antigens derived from TAA have been applied in immunotherapeutic trials for the treatment of various malignancies, e.g. cancers of the breast, prostate and kidney, in addition to haematological cancers. In some cases the response rates have been impressive and no adverse autoimmunity have been observed. A major strategic difficulty associated with these trials relates to the choice of best-suited peptide antigens. The vast majority of the antigens described thus far is not vital for survival and growth of the tumour cells, and immunoselection of antigen-loss variants may therefore prove to be an additional obstacle for the clinical applicability of most of the known peptide epitopes. In this respect, the development of acquired antigen loss during immunotherapy has been demonstrated in several cases. Obviously, the development of loss-variant tumour cells implies that these cells acquire a pronounced growth advantage and are left unaffected by further treatment. Ideally, target antigens should be derived from proteins required for survival and growth of tumour cells, as antigens with these characteristics would not be inflicted by the development of loss-variant tumour cells. In this respect, several inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are universally expressed among tumours and play an important role in tumour cell escape from apoptosis. We have characterized spontaneous T-cell reactivity against IAPderived peptides in cancer patients. From the IAP survivin, we have characterized peptides restricted to the Class I molecules HLA-A1, A2, A3, A11, B7 and B35. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that survivin-specific T cells infiltrate metastatic lesions and that isolated survivinspecific CTLs are capable of killing HLA-matched tumour cells. Survivin-derived peptides are now in clinical trial, and continued work in our lab has demonstrated that other IAPs are targets for spontaneous T-cell reactivity in cancer patients. We previously reported that in mice with large progressing T-cell lymphoma tumours, dysfunctions in the antitumour CTL activity occur, associated with an accumulation of splenic arginase-producing myeloid suppressor cells (MSCs). In this study, we first demonstrate that both the presence and the activation state of these MSC depends on tumour evolution. While in tumour regressors hardly any arginase-producing MSC can be found, both the amount and the arginase activity of this population expands from early over late progressors. This gradual induction of MSCs is paralleled by an increasing suppression of CTL activity and Th1, but not Th2, cytokine production. Upon analysing the molecular repertoire of MSC in vitro, we found, besides arginase1, a well-established marker for alternatively activated myeloid cells or M2, a strong upregulation of FIZZ1 and Ym, two additional recently identified markers for M2. Further evaluation of molecular markers by microarray analysis in MSC yielded genes involved in wound healing (e.g. coagulation factor XIIIa), anti-inflammation (e.g. selenoprotein P), immunomodulation (e.g. PD-L2) and fat and sugar metabolism (e.g. leptin receptor). Of note, many of these genes are regulated by type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13 and IL-10) and are therefore rather M2 associated. Overall, our data provide new markers for MSC in cancer and further establish their M2 activation state. study. Only SP-A showed a significant expression in normal mucosa which was downregulated in CRC. As the absolute signal level was below the noise threshold, these results have to be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by direct measurenment of the proteins. Our results suggest that there is no major role for the human collectins in colorectal cancer. |

Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number-the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naïve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January, 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% CI: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.	In the present study, the detection time window was fixed at 12.5 days, based assumed values for the incubation and infectious periods. The catchment population in Wuhan airport was also fixed at 11 million. As part of the sensitivity analysis, Table S2 shows the estimated growth rate, cumulative incidence and cCFR by varying only detection time window, while Table S3 shows the estimates with different catchment population sizes and a fixed detection time window for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. |

The number and the distribution of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions and deletions, with respect to a ""profile"", were determined and discussed (""profile"" being a sequence containing the most represented letter per position). Distribution of substitution categories per codon positions, as well as synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in coding regions of annotated isolates, was determined, along with amino acid (a.a.) property changes. Similar analysis was performed for the spike (S) protein in all the isolates (55 of them being predicted for the first time). The ratio Ka/Ks confirmed that the S gene was subjected to the Darwinian selection during virus transmission from animals to humans. Isolates from the dataset were classified according to genome polymorphism and genotypes. Genome polymorphism yields to two groups, one with a small number of SNVs and another with a large number of SNVs, with up to four subgroups with respect to insertions and deletions. We identified three basic nine-locus genotypes: TTTT/TTCGG, CGCC/TTCAT, and TGCC/TTCGT, with four subgenotypes. Both classifications proposed are in accordance with the new insights into possible epidemiological spread, both in space and time."	Non-synonymous nucleotide substitution per nonsynonymous site (Ka) and synonymous nucleotide substitution per synonymous site (Ks) were calculated using the DnaSP 4.0 program (45) . It is based on a method defined by Nei and Gojovori (46) that estimates the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions between two DNA sequences by counting the number of such substitutions in the corresponding pairs of codons. It also takes into account different evolutionary pathways between pairs of codons. The DnaSP program may run with or without an outgroup. The ratio Ka/Ks is considered as a selection parameter (Ka/Ks > 1 is usually interpreted as an indicator of positive selection). The coefficients Ka, Ks, as well as the ratio Ka/Ks were calculated first for the S protein in all the isolates in the dataset, without an outgroup. Since among the 91 isolates there were 89 human patients' isolates and 2 palm civet isolates (SZ3, SZ16), we then calculated the Ka and Ks coefficients and the ratio Ka/Ks for the 89 human patients' isolates only, without an outgroup, too. Eventually, we ran the program for all the human patients' isolates and each of the palm civet isolates as the outgroup, in order to test the hypothesis that the S gene was subjected to positive selection during virus transmission from animals to humans.|

Viral genome sequencing has emerged as a powerful means to link seemingly unrelated cases, and large-scale sequencing surveillance can inform on critical epidemiological parameters. Here, we report analysis of 156 SARS-CoV2 sequences from individuals in the New York City metropolitan area during the initial stages of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. The majority of samples had no recent travel history or known exposure. Comparison to global viral sequences showed that the majority of sequences were most related to samples from Europe. Our data are consistent with numerous seed transmissions and a period of unrecognized community spreading. This work highlights the complementary role of genomic surveillance to traditional epidemiological indicators.	is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10. 1101 |

In this study, we have developed an unbiased modeling approach to identify new pathways and network connections mediating acute lung injury, using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as a model pathogen. We utilized a time course of matched virologic, pathological, and transcriptomic data within a novel methodological framework that can detect pathway enrichment among key highly connected network genes. This unbiased approach produced a high-priority list of 4 genes in one pathway out of over 3,500 genes that were differentially expressed following SARS-CoV infection. With these data, we predicted that the urokinase and other wound repair pathways would regulate lethal versus sublethal disease following SARS-CoV infection in mice. We validated the importance of the urokinase pathway for SARS-CoV disease severity using genetically defined knockout mice, proteomic correlates of pathway activation, and pathological disease severity. The results of these studies demonstrate that a fine balance exists between host coagulation and fibrinolysin pathways regulating pathological disease outcomes, including diffuse alveolar damage and acute lung injury, following infection with highly pathogenic respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV.

The massive efforts made these past 25 years to increase the immunizing potential of this kind of vaccine are still ongoing. A relatively small number of studies concerning poultry have been published. Even though there is a need for new poultry vaccines, five parameters must nevertheless be taken into account for their development: the vaccine has to be very effective, safe, inexpensive, suitable for mass vaccination and able to induce immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies (when appropriate). DNA vaccination should meet these requirements. This review describes studies in this field performed exclusively on birds (chickens, ducks and turkeys). No evaluations of avian DNA vaccine efficacy performed on mice as preliminary tests have been taken into consideration. The review first describes the state of the art for DNA vaccination in poultry: pathogens targeted, plasmids used and different routes of vaccine administration. Second, it presents strategies designed to improve DNA vaccine efficacy: influence of the route of administration, plasmid dose and age of birds on their first inoculation; increasing plasmid uptake by host cells; addition of immunomodulators; optimization of plasmid backbones and codon usage; association of vaccine antigens and finally, heterologous prime-boost regimens. The final part will indicate additional properties of DNA vaccines in poultry: fate of the plasmids upon inoculation, immunological considerations and the use of DNA vaccines for purposes other than preventing infectious diseases.	DNA vaccination is an appropriate and simple concept that could be developed to better advantage in poultry vaccination, especially for chickens, ducks and turkeys. It has most often been evaluated in the literature in relation to fighting viral infections, but promising results have also been obtained for anti-bacterial and anti-protozoan properties. Several strategies designed to enhance the protective immune response have also been shown to be successful. Some would be very useful for mass vaccination, such as DNA vaccines transported by Salmonella typhimurium, in ovo or IN vaccination. However, despite the substantial efforts made since 1993, no vaccine has reached the industrial development stage. This may be due to the fact that the vast majority of vaccines were injected intramuscularly and needed at least two injections, which is not feasible in the field. Furthermore, the assays were mainly performed with SPF birds. In real life, young birds may harbor passive maternal antibodies against the pathogen of interest that have been shown to hinder, at least partially, the induction of immunity. Protection was nonetheless achieved in a number of cases, proving that DNA vaccination in the presence of maternal antibodies is still possible, at least against certain pathogens. Therefore, further efforts should be made to develop DNA vaccines suited to the mass vaccination of birds with or without maternal antibodies.|

Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model based on machine learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that many FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.

In this letter, we propose a novel and successful targeted immunization strategy based on percolation transition. Our strategy repeatedly looks for the critical nodes for immunizing. The critical node, which leads to the emergence of the giant connected component as the degree threshold increases, is determined when the maximal second-largest connected component disappears. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct the experiments on several artificial networks and real-world networks. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the degree centrality strategy, the betweenness centrality strategy and the adaptive degree centrality strategy with 18% to 50% fewer immunized nodes for same amount of immunization.	to 50% compared to the degree centrality strategy, the betweenness centrality strategy and the adaptive degree centrality strategy. |

925	2a975461d98da20a4e7647bf822858cf107b69e9	Challenges posed by new and re-emerging infectious diseases in livestock production, wildlife and humans ☆	"In today's world, emerging and re-emerging diseases have a significant impact on global economies and public health, and with bioterrorism a constant threat this has become a very topical subject in recent years. Bernard Vallat, director general of the OIE, made the statement, ""As a result of globalisation and climate change we are currently facing an unprecedented worldwide impact of emerging and re-emerging animal diseases and zoonoses"". He is not alone in this thinking, but are we facing an unprecedented impact of diseases and are globalisation and climate change the main driving forces? This paper examines some historical disease outbreaks and the factors that played a role in their emergence and compares these with recent emerging diseases. In doing so it highlights certain challenges that face livestock producers and decision makers today as they grapple with emerging diseases. One of the driving forces for the emergence of diseases is translocation of people and their livestock and this has often been coupled with invading armies or peoples, political unrest and a concurrent environment of socio-economic upheaval. Contact between wild animals, domestic animals and people is another driving force involving the interaction between naïve population groups that induces the emergence of new diseases. Pandemics are not new to human society and nor are many of the driving forces that caused them to occur in the past; what has changed is our increased knowledge and awareness of disease dynamics, allowing identification of challenges for the future and ways of addressing these. Modern farming practices often serve to amplify emerging infectious diseases and modern trade and transport mechanisms and routes have served to sometimes accelerate the spread of disease. How can we reduce the risks and should we only be worried about emerging infectious diseases or are emerging non-communicable diseases just as important in our modern society? This paper serves to explain some of the reasons for the emergence of diseases and to try and answer some of the pressing questions that confront livestock producers today."	In conclusion then, we are not facing an unprecedented impact of emerging or re-emerging disease. There are many historical examples where diseases have played a much more dramatic role in the life of man than in modern times. The driving forces for infectious emerging diseases, namely translocation, overcrowding, socio-economic upheaval and contact with naïve populations, have remained the same since the recorded history of disease outbreaks. However, new diagnostic methodologies facilitate the identification of the diseases and the driving forces. We know more about how disease dynamics work today and are better equipped than ever before to deal with it. The main challenge is recognising the complexity of emerging diseases and identifying the key determinants. If we know the determinants we can implement the correct control strategies, provided we have the will to do so. Finally, it is apparent that non-infectious environmental contaminants are likely to play an increasingly important role as emerging diseases.|

Evidence from Dublin	"A B S T R A C T Some trips are better than others, and more and more studies find that active travel (walking and cycling) is more satisfying than motorized forms of travel (using the car or public transport). Why is this the case? Using data on travel satisfaction from 4134 commutes to a large University campus in Dublin, Ireland, this paper replicates the differences in travel satisfaction between active and motorized travel. We attribute these differences in large part to the duration of the trip. Subjective trip characteristics, such as safety and convenience, also play important roles. The trip duration explains rush-hour effects as well as why people starting from less affluent and more difficult-to-reach places are less satisfied with their trips. Longer-term policy options suggested by these results include infrastructure developments and spatial development strategies. A shorter-term initiative would be to delay university schedules in the morning to avoid low travel satisfaction during the slow rush-hour period and simultaneously ease pressure on the transport network at peak times. (L.K. Lades). 1 Of course, in many cases people are not able to decide whether to live close or far away from their workplaces as this is determined by, for example, budget constraints. Travel choices are often influenced by other, longer-term choices regarding, for example, lifestyle and residential location. 2 The terms ""welfare"" and well-being are often used interchangeably in the literature on welfare economics. Transportation Research Part A 136 (2020) 318-333 0965-8564/"	Finally, we have proposed an ambitious policy intervention about a delayed starting schedule and/or increased remote learning for the University campus. National ambitions relating to reduced GHG emissions, improved ambient air quality, and better citizen health and well-being could benefit from these policies. There are surmountable complexities relating to the design of such schemes, as well as a number of interactions and outcomes that would influence the degree to which the initiative may reduce emissions. Nonetheless, the primary motivation for the measure would be to reduce travel time, ease pressure on peak transport services, and enhance travel satisfaction for all. In order to advance this proposal, we would recommend further research on the policy design, with a potential ex-ante ex-post case study utilizing selected University units as a precursor to the possibility of a campus-wide measure. |
927	facad02ff5caf7e9fb4b538296e9ee594e40eac5	Airway permeability		The intact airway epithelium has tight cell to cell contacts at the apical pole ofthe cylindrical cells. However, the tight mucosa still absorbs small molecules through paracellular routes. Even proteins are absorbed but at slow rates. In exudative eosinophilic allergic disease the airway absorptivity may not be increased. It can even be decreased. This novel notion of mucosal tightness in inflammation is compatible with recent observations in two other areas of research: 'Mechanisms of mucosal exudation of plasma' and 'Mechanisms of restitution of epithelial lining cells after shedding'. When the intact airway mucosa is exposed to inflammatory agents including allergen, it responds with mucosal exudation of 'bulk' plasma. Aided by a self-sustained hydraulic pressure, the large plasma proteins enter the airway lumen without increasing the airway absorption ability. This paracellular valve-like mechanism ofthe normal columnar epithelium makes luminal entry of plasma a significant flrst line defence mechanism [5] . Sustained inflammatory processes cause epithelial damage, and epithelial shedding may be extensive in rhinitis and asthma. If only columnar cells are shed the remaining basal cells may promptly flatten out and tighten the barrier. If denudation occurs the basement membrane is immediately covered by a plasma-derived gel. The gel also provides a special milieu in which bordering ciliated, secretory, and basal cells dedifferentiate, flatten and migrate speedily. A new epithelial lining is established in such a milieu and at such high speed that epithelial shedding should probably also be considered a well functioning airway defence process. The new findings on basal cell responses at columnar cell losses and on reepithelialization in a plasma-derived gel in vivo after denudation may in part explain why increased absorption permeability has not been widely demonstrated in allergic and other inflammatory airway diseases. Perhaps the clues to explain increased absorption tightness in asthma and rhinitis can also be found among mucosal exudation and repair mechanisms as they evolve under proper in vivo conditions.|

A study was conducted to estimate the incidence and the burden of self-defined influenza, and to describe healthcare seeking behavior for self-defined influenza during the A(H1N1)2009 pandemic in the French population. Methods: We conducted a random-based retrospective cross-sectional telephone survey between May 2009 and April 2010 among a random sample of the French population.	This telephone survey allows a more accurate interpretation of the data derived from healthcare provider-based influenza surveillance systems. GP and hospital-based surveillance systems underestimate the burden of influenza, as around two out of every three cases consulted a GP. Improvement in implementing hygiene measures was observed in the context of the pandemic and the analysis of the determinants gives relevant information for adapting future health education messages.|

An exciting new approach for the next generation of antibody therapeutics is mixtures of individual antibodies, selected to capitalize on functional synergy and inhibit generation of escape variants. Advances in antibody repertoire characterization are facilitating deconvolution of the polyclonal immune response to a minimal set of antibodies recognizing complementary epitopes with characterized mechanisms of protection and will prove key to selecting antibodies for inclusion in these cocktails. Similarly, transformative new technologies are emerging in terms of highly polyclonal recombinant antibody therapeutics, led by the pioneering anti-RhD product, Sym001.

932	e5f65e5c8df2bfcda5d3e152feb0afbb476102b3	Natural Products from Sponges	The sponge is one of the oldest multicellular invertebrates in the world. Marine sponges represent one of the extant metazoans of 700-800 million years. They are classified in four major classes: Calcarea, Demospongiae, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha. Among them, three genera, namely, Haliclona, Petrosia, and Discodemia have been identified to be the richest source of biologically active compounds. So far, 15,000 species have been described, and among them, more than 6000 species are found in marine and freshwater systems throughout tropical, temperate, and polar regions. More than 5000 different compounds have been 330 isolated and structurally characterized to date, contributing to about 30% of all marine natural products. The chemical diversity of sponge products is high with compounds classified as alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides, polyketides, steroids, and macrolides, which integrate a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial. There is an open debate whether all natural products isolated from sponges are produced by sponges or are in fact derived from microorganisms that are inhaled though filterfeeding or that live within the sponges. Apart from their origin and chemoecological functions, sponge-derived metabolites are also of considerable interest in drug development. Therefore, development of recombinant microorganisms engineered for efficient production of sponge-derived products is a promising strategy that deserves further attention in future investigations in order to address the limitations regarding sustainable supply of marine drugs.	Spongistatin is a macrocyclic lactone that has been isolated from the marine sponges Spirastrella spinispirulifera and Hyrtios sp. by the group of Pettit. Spongistatin 1 (Fig. 15.20) showed interesting apoptotic features in various tumor cells. In leukemic cell lines, it triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Spongistatin 1 caused degradation of the anti-apoptotic XIAP, which suggested it might be a promising drug for the treatment of chemoresistance due to overexpression of XIAP. Moreover spongistatin 1 induces apoptosis more efficiently in human primary leukemic cells of children suffering from acute leukemia at low nanomolar concentrations than clinically applied conventional drugs used in micromolar concentrations. In addition normal healthy peripheral blood cells were significantly less affected by spongistatin 1 [353] . Besides leukemic cells, spongistatin 1 showed promising apoptotic potential in mammary cancer cells including the treatment-resistant cell line MCF-7 lacking caspase-3. Regarding the apoptotic signaling pathways of spongistatin 1, two interesting features can be reported. First, spongistatin 1-induced cell death involves the pro-apoptotic proteins AIF and endonuclease G. Both proteins translocate from mitochondria to the nucleus and contribute to spongistatin 1-mediated apoptosis as shown via gene silencing. Second, spongistatin 1 acts as a tubulin-depolymerizing agent and is able to free the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim from its sequestration both by the microtubular complex and by the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Silencing of Bim by siRNA leads to a diminished translocation of AIF and endonuclease G to the nucleus and subsequently reduces rate of apoptosis. By using spongistatin 1 as a chemical tool, Bim has been suggested to be an important factor upstream of mitochondria by executing a central role in the caspase-independent apoptotic signaling pathway induced by spongistatin 1. These different apoptotic features indicate that the apoptosis signaling is cell line-specific. Finally, spongistatin 1 affects highly invasive pancreatic tumor cells by not only inhibiting their invasion and migration but also by inducing anoikis in these cells. Bcl-2 seems to be a major target for spongistatin 1 in these processes. Besides tumor cells, spongistatin inhibits angiogenic activity of endothelial cells via inhibition of PKC-a [354] .|

Increasing data indicate that PRRSV strains differ in virulence in infected pigs and are biologically, antigenically, and genetically heterogeneous. It is evident that the current vaccines, based on a single PRRSV strain, are not effective in protecting against infections with the genetically diverse ®eld strains of PRRSV. The recent outbreaks of atypical or acute PRRS in vaccinated pigs have raised a serious concern about the ef®cacy of the current vaccines and provided the impetus for developing more effective vaccines. Special attention in this review is given to published work on antigenic, pathogenic and genetic variations of PRRSV and its potential implications for vaccine ef®cacy and development. Although there are ample data documenting the heterogeneous nature of PRRSV strains, information regarding how the heterogeneity is generated and what clinical impact it may have is very scarce. The observed heterogeneity will likely pose a major obstacle for effective prevention and control of PRRS. There remains an urgent need for fundamental research on this virus to understand the basic biology and the mechanism of heterogeneity and pathogenesis of PRRSV. #	The emergence and re-emergence of viral infectious diseases is often in¯uenced by the genetics of the viruses (Domingo and Holland, 1992; Duarte et al., 1994; Domingo et al., 1998) . Genetic heterogeneity of PRRSV, due to quasispecies evolution and RNA recombination, could lead to the selection of virulent viruses and to the emergence or reemergence of new forms of PRRS. Quasispecies evolution of PRRSV in response to positive or negative selection pressures may signi®cantly change the genomic sequence of MLVs over time as the vaccine virus spreads among swine herds, and ultimately, these genetic changes may revert MLVs to virulent phenotypes. It is also possible that virulent strains of PRRSV could be generated through RNA recombination between MLVs used in the vaccination programs and enzootic ®eld strains of PRRSV. The recent outbreaks of the atypical or acute PRRS re¯ect the need to further study this virus to better understand its biology and develop more effective vaccines. Most of the herds affected by the atypical PRRS had been vaccinated with the current vaccines (Bell, 1998; Lager et al., 1998) . It is possible that a mutant strain(s) of PRRSV may be responsible for the recent outbreaks of acute PRRS. The heterogeneous nature of PRRSV suggests that complete elimination of the virus from the environment is unlikely. The observed genetic diversity among ®eld isolates of PRRSV will continue to be the major obstacle for PRRS control. Therefore, the design for the next generation of vaccines will have to take into consideration the genetic heterogeneity of PRRSV, or PRRS will remain dif®cult to control. Intensive research is required to answer the many questions that remain. The recently constructed infectious cDNA clone of PRRSV should enable us to study the basic biology of PRRSV. Using the infectious cDNA clone, one can monitor the nature of quasispecies evolution of PRRSV in pigs infected by a homogeneous virus derived from the infectious clone. One can also genetically engineer the virus to produce a modi®ed avirulent strain that could be used as an MLV. The immunogenic gene(s) of the genetically-engineered avirulent strain of PRRSV can be replaced with that of other antigenically and genetically distinct PRRSV strains to produce avirulent virus strains that can be used as a multivalent MLV.|
936	d800e113c0f37fea4586a18115d07a7bbb3e5464	The ATF6 branch of unfolded protein response and apoptosis are activated to promote African swine fever virus infection	African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection induces apoptosis in the infected cell; however, the consequences of this activation on virus replication have not been defined. In order to identify the role of apoptosis in ASFV infection, we analyzed caspase induction during the infection and the impact of caspase inhibition on viral production. Caspases 3, 9 and 12 were activated from 16 h post-infection, but not caspase 8. Indeed, caspase 3 activation during the early stages of the infection appeared to be crucial for efficient virus exit. In addition, the inhibition of membrane blebbing reduced the release of virus particles from the cell. ASFV uses the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a site of replication and this process can trigger ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the host cell. In addition to caspase 12 activation, indicators of ER stress include the upregulation of the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin upon virus infection. Moreover, ASFV induces transcription factor 6 signaling pathway of the UPR, but not the protein kinase-like ER kinase or the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 pathways. Thus, the capacity of ASFV to regulate the UPR may prevent early apoptosis and ensure viral replication.	Data analysis. One-way analysis of variance was performed using INSTAT 3 for Windows.

The role of the microbiology laboratory, in particular, is of pivotal importance to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the pathogen causing CAP, so that appropriate antibiotic therapy can be initiated as soon as possible, avoiding excessive use of broad spectrum antimicrobials, which increase the selection of resistant pathogens.|
939	288d96a77df44759ee1026f9e51867323a1f07fa			Understanding the multifactorial, temporally dynamic nature of neonatal calf diarrhea in cattle populations is the basis for developing strategies for control and prevention. The common pathogens of neonatal calf diarrhea are endemic to most cattle herds, and it is unlikely that cattle populations could be made biosecure from these agents. Managers of extensive beef cattle systems have few opportunities to improve rates of passive transfer, and vaccines are not always protective. Lactogenic immunity wanes, making calves age susceptible and age infective. Each calf serves as growth media for pathogen production, amplifying the dose-load of pathogen it received and resulting in high calf infectivity and widespread environmental contamination over time in a calving season. For these reasons it is logical to apply biocontainment strategies to prevent effective transmission of the pathogens causing neonatal diarrhea. Cattle management systems based on an understanding of infectious disease dynamics have successfully reduced sickness and death caused by neonatal calf diarrhea.|

There are no licensed RSV vaccines available, and the few treatment options for high-risk individuals are either extremely costly or cause severe side effects and toxicity. Immunomodulation mediated by a novel formulation consisting of the toll-like receptor 3 agonist poly(I:C), an innate defense regulator peptide and a polyphosphazene (P-I-P) was evaluated in the context of lethal infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Intranasal delivery of a single dose of P-I-P protected adult mice against PVM when given 24 h prior to challenge. These animals experienced minimal weight loss, no clinical disease, 100% survival, and reduced lung pathology. Similar clinical outcomes were observed in mice treated up to 3 days prior to infection. P-I-P pre-treatment induced early mRNA and protein expression of key chemokine and cytokine genes, reduced the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils, decreased virus titers in the lungs, and modulated the delayed exacerbated nature of PVM disease without any short-term side effects. On day 14 post-infection, P-I-P-treated mice were confirmed to be PVM-free. These results demonstrate the capacity of this formulation to prevent PVM and possibly other viral respiratory infections.	We propose that P-I-P can be used prophylactically for the prevention of RSV infections in high-risk populations like the elderly, who possess immune systems that do not perform optimally due to immune senescence. These individuals could be treated with the P-I-P formulation during outbreaks of RSV or possibly other respiratory infections such that partial immune protection can be provided. P-I-P acts primarily at level of the innate immune system of the host, which allows us to speculate on the possibility of a well-established P-I-P therapy to protect patients from multiple viral infections at once. It would be beneficial if one can protect the most vulnerable populations from major diseases like influenza, coronavirus, and RSV infections as most of these tend to be transmitted through the same route of exposure and during the same seasons. Studies confirming such pleiotropic effect are yet to be performed. Fig. 10 .

The agents of leptospirosis comprise several members of the genus Leptospira, which also includes non-pathogenic, saprophytic species. Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild, nonspecific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To begin to investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells, we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Microarray analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa triggered changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix, but that the changes were in opposite directions, with infection by L. biflexa primarily predicted to increase or maintain cell layer integrity, while L. interrogans lead primarily to changes predicted to disrupt cell layer integrity. Neither bacterial strain caused necrosis or apoptosis of the cells even after prolonged incubation. The pathogenic L. interrogans, however, did result in significant disruption of endothelial cell layers as assessed by microscopy and the ability of the bacteria to cross the cell layers. This disruption of endothelial layer integrity was abrogated by addition of the endothelial protective drug lisinopril at physiologically relevant concentrations. These results suggest that, through adhesion of L. interrogans to endothelial cells, the bacteria may disrupt endothelial barrier function, promoting dissemination of the bacteria and contributing to severe disease manifestations. In addition, supplementing antibiotic therapy with lisinopril or derivatives with endothelial protective activities may decrease the severity of leptospirosis. Citation: Martinez-Lopez DG, Fahey M, Coburn J (2010) Responses of Human Endothelial Cells to Pathogenic and Non-Pathogenic Leptospira Species. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 4(12): e918.	Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, as indicated by our microarray studies and by phalloidin staining of F actin, is essential to the pathogenesis of diverse bacterial infections, and pathogens use many different strategies to provoke changes in the cellular cytoskeleton in order to facilitate invasion of tissues, invasion of host cells, or evasion of phagocytosis (as reviewed in [24, 41, 42] ). A different spirochete, Treponema denticola, produces the protein Msp, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton in neutrophils and fibro-blasts, preventing phagocytosis of the bacterium and inhibiting the cellular migration required to respond to and repair the damage caused by the pathogen and the host response at the site of infection [43, 44] . These activities are likely to facilitate invasion and colonization of periodontal tissues by T. denticola. Previous work by another laboratory demonstrated that L. interrogans Copenhageni crosses MDCK canine kidney epithelial cell layers in culture more rapidly than does L. biflexa Patoc [45] , but without significant disruption to the cell layers or the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with these results, in experiments not shown here we also observed no significant damage to NRK (normal rat kidney) 293 (human kidney) or HEp-2 (human laryngeal) epithelial cell layers infected with L. interrogans Canicola or L. interrogans Copenhageni. The calculations of the proportions of bacteria crossing the cell layers differed between the two studies, but our protocol accounted for the replication of the L. interrogans Canicola and Copenhageni in the co-cultures, while the L. biflexa Patoc did not replicate (data not shown). Thus the endothelial cells tested here respond very differently to the bacteria than did the MDCK epithelial cells, and our results are the first to suggest a mechanism: disruption of actin dynamics by bacterial attachment to the cell surface. Thus, while L. interrogans has not been shown to secrete a toxin that modifies actin, the bacteria are able to manipulate the actin cytoskeleton indirectly. Even the pore forming toxin activity reported for Leptospira [46, 47] does not appear to have as large an effect, as the endothelial cells here were viable throughout the experiments. The leptospires may be able to establish disseminated infection in part due to the binding of the bacteria to one or more mammalian cell surface receptors that in turn, regulate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in the mammalian cell. Deciphering the role of, and mechanisms behind, actin rearrangement in response to pathogenic Leptospira will provide insights into the mechanisms that leptospires uses to disseminate to different organs of the host to cause infection and disease, and provides a possible avenue for therapeutic intervention in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy.|

To investigate microbial diversity and quantity in the brain, the profile of infectious agents was examined in pathologically normal and abnormal brains from persons with HIV/AIDS [HIV] (n = 12), other disease controls [ODC] (n = 14) and in cerebral surgical resections for epilepsy [SURG] (n = 6). Deep sequencing of cerebral white matter-derived RNA from the HIV (n = 4) and ODC (n = 4) patients and SURG (n = 2) groups revealed bacterially-encoded 16 s RNA sequences in all brain specimens with a-proteobacteria representing over 70% of bacterial sequences while the other 30% of bacterial classes varied widely. Bacterial rRNA was detected in white matter glial cells by in situ hybridization and peptidoglycan immunoreactivity was also localized principally in glia in human brains. Analyses of amplified bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences disclosed that Proteobacteria was the principal bacterial phylum in all human brain samples with similar bacterial rRNA quantities in HIV and ODC groups despite increased host neuroimmune responses in the HIV group. Exogenous viruses including bacteriophage and human herpes viruses-4, -5 and -6 were detected variably in autopsied brains from both clinical groups. Brains from SIV-and SHIV-infected macaques displayed a profile of bacterial phyla also dominated by Proteobacteria but bacterial sequences were not detected in experimentally FIV-infected cat or RAG1 2/2 mouse brains. Intracerebral implantation of human brain homogenates into RAG1 2/2 mice revealed a preponderance of a-proteobacteria 16 s RNA sequences in the brains of recipient mice at 7 weeks post-implantation, which was abrogated by prior heat-treatment of the brain homogenate. Thus, a-proteobacteria represented the major bacterial component of the primate brain's microbiome regardless of underlying immune status, which could be transferred into naïve hosts leading to microbial persistence in the brain.	Human cerebral white matter (80 mg) from autopsied ODC13 and 14 brains was homogenized in 800 mL of PBS. The ODC13derived sample was heat-treated at 65uC for 25 minutes. 2.0 mL of each homogenized human brain suspension was stereotactically implanted into the striatum of RAG1 2/2 mice (n = 3) under anesthesia. Animals were maintained under group housing for 7 weeks then sacrificed and the brain collected from which RNA was extracted, as described above for the human samples. Figure S1 Network analyses of host gene expression in relation to bacterial quantity. The identified 75 host genes associated with bacterial quantity were subjected to network analyses generating a network (IPA score 21) emphasizing genes that participated principally in cell morphology, division and maintenance function, e.g. calreticulin, SLC12A, KLF1, netrin (NTN1). Red shading indicates a positive correlation and green shading indicates negative correlation. Thus, there was an apparent association between host genes implicated in essential brain maintenance and functions with bacterial quantity.

Peptidoglycanpositive bodies were morphologically consistent with bacteria and distributed throughout the tissue (Magnification, left column, 100X) in all patients (Magnification, right column 400X) small clusters of bodies labeled with the anti-peptidoglycan antibody were apparent both perivascularly and in the parenchyma as well as intracellularly (Arrows).

The potential anti-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) activity of the POMs [a-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7À isomers was investigated in this paper by molecular modeling method. The SARS 3c like protease, namely the SARS 3CL pro is the key function protease for virus replication as well as transcription and thus can be taken as one of the key targets for anti-SARS drug design. Affinity/ Insight II was used to explore possible binding locations for POMs/3CL pro interaction. Charges in the POMs were obtained from density-functional theory (DFT) method. The results show that POMs bind with 3CL pro in the active site region with high affinity; POMs are more prone to bind with 3CL pro than with some organic compounds; for the POMs/3CL pro complex, the OTi 2 in POMs is the vital element for electrostatic interaction, and the electrostatic binding energy is strong enough to keep the complex stable.	Docking investigations on five POM ([a-PTi 2 W 10 O 40 ] 7À ) isomers with SARS-CoV 3CL pro were performed using computer assisted molecular simulation technology. The investigation results show that: (1) POMs interact with the 3CL pro receptor in enzyme active site region, with several polarized residues including the enzyme catalyst residues of His41/Cys145; (2) The total binding energies of the five POM/SARS-CoV 3CL pro complexes lead to the following order of complex stability: 1,2-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,4-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,5-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,6-PTi 2 /3CL pro > 1,11-PTi 2 /3CL pro . (3) Electrostatic energy and hydrogen bond interaction contribute much to the enzyme-inhibitor complex formation between POMs and SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The atom charge loading property and electrostatic characteristic are very vital elements that keep the enzyme-inhibitor interaction. In POMs, the electronegative OTi 2 oxygen contributes much for electrostatic energy interactions. As a result, those POMs with OTi 2 oxygen should form relative stable complex with protein receptors. The simulation results provide important information for POMs/SARS-CoV 3CL pro interaction, and may provide insights for anti-SARS drug design. |

The recommendations from the forums in this study suggest that the distribution of scarce resources and the implementation of quarantine and social distancing measures in Australia in a severe pandemic will be challenging, but not impossible.

In a study of 205 patients suffering from cold, influenza or respiratory syncitial viral infection, 161 genes overexpressed while 235 genes were identified to express specifically in influenza and well before the symptoms appeared. The host gene expression once refined in due course of time, may be able to differentiate viral from bacterial infections and may become a part of antimicrobial stewardship program. 1 Tuberculosis kills 1.5 million persons per year in the world. Rapid and accurate diagnosis still remains a challenge. The detection of Mycobacteria (by microscopy, culture, molecular, assays) and host immune response (tuberculin skin test and IGRAs) have been the current approaches in clinical practice. A study of 2572 samples from pediatric and adult patients from 10 countries has shown three genes: GBP5, DUSP3 and KLF2 to be highly diagnostic of active tuberculosis. Their expression declines with treatment. Also bacterial drug resistance, prior BCG vaccination or HIV status has no influence on the expression of these three genes. 2 Thus host gene expression in infectious diseases may be the future diagnostic tool.|

The genomic sequence of this animal model is not yet characterized, and only a limited number of fully annotated cDNAs are currently available in GenBank. The majority of genes involved in innate or adaptive immune response are still lacking, restricting molecular genetic analysis of host response in the ferret model. To enable de novo identification of transcriptionally active ferret genes in response to infection, we performed de-novo transcriptome sequencing of animals infected with H1N1 A/California/07/2009. We also included splenocytes induced with bacterial lipopolysaccharide to allow for identification of transcripts specifically induced by Gram-negative bacteria. We pooled and normalized the cDNA library in order to delimit the risk of sequencing only highly expressed genes. While normalization of the cDNA library removes the possibility of assessing expression changes between individual animals, it has been shown to increase identification of low abundant transcripts. In this study, we identified more than 19000 partial ferret transcripts, including more than 1000 gene orthologs known to be involved in the innate and the adaptive immune response.	http://publications.scilifelab.se/svensson_lt/ ferret_transcriptome.

If this international research effort is going to be as swift and effective as possible, it will need to rely on a principle of open science. When researchers share data, code, and software and generally make their work as transparent as possible, it allows other researchers to verify and expand upon their work. Furthermore, it allows public officials to make informed decisions. In this study, we analyzed 535 preprint articles related to COVID-19 for eight transparency criteria and recorded study location and funding information. We found that individual researchers have lined up to help during this crisis, quickly tackling important public health questions, often without funding or support from outside organizations. However, most authors could improve their data sharing and scientific reporting practices. The contrast between researchers' commitment to doing important research and their reporting practices reveals underlying weaknesses in the research community's reporting habits, but not necessarily their science.	Whichever interventions the scientific community eventually implements, we hope that those researchers committed to combating the COVID-19 outbreak will recognize the inherent importance of open science. Many of these researchers seem to be motivated by altruism rather than career, so we must continue to highlight those reporting practices that will facilitate reproducibility and falsifiability. Finally, we must reiterate the general importance of open science: that our best work comes from the knowledge we create together, across borders and with collaborators we may never know exist.|

Vaccination (using an inactivated rabies vaccine), combined with administration of rabies immune globulin, is the only approved, effective method for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies in humans. In the search for novel rabies control and treatment strategies, live-attenuated viruses have recently emerged as a practical and promising approach for immunizing and controlling rabies. Unlike the conventional, inactivated rabies vaccine, live-attenuated viruses are genetically modified viruses that are able to replicate in an inoculated recipient without causing adverse effects, while still eliciting robust and effective immune responses against rabies virus infection. A number of viruses with an intrinsic capacity that could be used as putative candidates for live-attenuated rabies vaccine have been intensively evaluated for therapeutic purposes. Additional novel strategies, such as a monoclonal antibody-based approach, nucleic acid-based vaccines, or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) interfering with virus replication, could further add to the arena of strategies to combat rabies. In this review, we highlight current advances in rabies therapy and discuss the role that they might have in the future of rabies treatment. Given the pronounced and complex impact of rabies on a patient, a combination of these novel modalities has the potential to achieve maximal anti-rabies efficacy, or may even have promising curative effects in the future. However, several hurdles regarding clinical safety considerations and public awareness should be overcome before these approaches can ultimately become clinically relevant therapies. exposed on the surface of the virus and is not only the major determinant of viral pathogenicity, but also the major protective antigen responsible for inducing protective immunity against rabies [2] [3] [4] [5] .	Lastly, it is important to note that while some promising results have been achieved in animal models that PEP (with live-attenuated virus-based rabies vaccines) were effective, even when administered late after challenge infection, these treatments were largely prophylactic. Therefore, these treatments have not been shown to be curative, as the animals were not exhibiting any clinical signs at the time when the treatment was performed. Currently there is no solid, scientific evidence for any curative interventions. More studies are needed to further investigate the potential of curative interventions for clinical use. In the future, appropriate combinations of a rabies vaccine, antiviral drugs, immunotherapy, and neuroprotective therapy could profoundly reshape rabies treatment and benefit more patients suffering from rabies.|

The aim of this study is to determine whether there is any difference in selected cytokine or chemokines response in asthmatic children compared to non-asthmatic children during acute M. pneumoniae pneumonia. Methods: Seventy-five children, 6-12 years of age, admitted with M. pneumoniae pneumonia were enrolled. Two patient groups were defined: the children with known asthma (N = 40) and non-asthmatic children (N = 35). Interleukin (IL)-18 and selected chemokines, IL-8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and regulation upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) were measured by means of ELISA in the plasma samples of the patients collected on admission. We investigated the values of these mediators in relation to the asthma status and symptom severity of the patients. Twenty age-matched, non-infected controls were also studied. Results: Plasma levels of IL-18 and the chemokines increased significantly in the patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia compared to non-infected, age-matched controls (P < 0.01). However, the asthmatic patients showed significantly reduced IL-18 and CXCL10 responses (P < 0.01, <0.05, respectively) and had more severe pneumonia symptoms (P < 0.01) compared to non-asthmatic patients. IL-18 was significantly lower in severe pneumonia group than in non-severe group (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study suggests that IL-18 and the chemokines are importantly involved in the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia. It also indicates that some asthmatic children have deficient IL-18 response when affected by M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which might be associated with more severe pneumonia observed in this group of patients.	In summary, our study showed that IL-18 and selected chemokines increased significantly in the children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which suggests that these mediators are importantly involved in the pathogenesis of this acute respiratory infection. However, the patients with known asthma showed significantly decreased IL-18 and CXCL10 responses and experienced more severe pneumonia compared to non-asthmatic patients. IL-18 level was significantly lower in severe pneumonia group than in non-severe group. Our results suggest that some asthmatic children have deficient IL-18 response when affected by M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which might be associated with more severe pneumonia observed in this group of patients.|

Many priority research questions remain to be answered before the true pandemic potential and global impact of MERS-CoV can be accurately determined. Almost all patients who died or those who have been hospitalized with severe disease had other comorbid medical conditions [4] . The mortality rate and severity of disease are exaggerated to some degree by detection of such cases. The case-fatality rate has fallen in recent months due to the detection of milder and asymptomatic cases [7] . Determining the true spectrum of MERS-CoV infection and disease severity requires widespread viral testing, collection of clinical data, and serologic studies. Case-control studies are essential for defining the MERS-CoV outbreak, and validated accurate serological tests, which are sensitive and specific, are required to facilitate these. The most ominous characteristic of pandemic MERS-CoV strains would be progression to efficient human-to-human transmission. The number of sporadic MERS cases being reported has been small and indicates that the virus appears not readily capable of rapid human-to-human transmission. Despite extensive investigation and testing of hundreds of contacts by the KSA Ministry of health, only a few instances of transmission to healthcare workers or family contacts were identified [6, 7, 9] . Sequencing studies of all MERS-CoV genomes may reveal genetic features that will tell us if MERS-CoV has the ability to mutate and spread efficiently. The rapid sharing of genetic sequence information [10, 33] will provide valuable insights into the understanding of the molecular characteristics and transmission dynamics, which will assist in defining species specificity, ascertaining mutation rates and virulence, and also enabling discovery of drug targets, novel drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines. Two million pilgrims from over 180 countries, and 1 million local KSA pilgrims, have recently visited Makkah and Madinah, KSA, to perform the 2013 annual Hajj pilgrimage, and have returned home after stays of between 2 and 8 weeks. Millions of others will visit KSA throughout the year for the minipilgrimage Umrah. While answers to priority research on MERS-CoV are being sought, the need for more coordinated surveillance and improved effective international cooperation between WHO, Middle Eastern governments, academic stakeholders, and pharmaceutical companies remains critical to tackling this ominous threat [34] . It is rather disconcerting that major knowledge gaps remain for the current MERS-CoV outbreak over a year after its first discovery. Once again, this illustrates that there remains a dire need for the establishment of robust public health and clinical infrastructures, effective global consortia, and a stable funding source for rapid and effective definition of new infectious diseases outbreaks and threats, and for prioritizing research, preparedness, and response efforts.|

All type III IFNs initiate signaling processes through formation of specific heterodimeric receptor complexes consisting of IFN-λR1 and IL-10R2. We have determined the structure of human IFN-λ1 complexed with human IFN-λR1, a receptor unique to type III IFNs. The overall structure of IFN-λ1 is topologically similar to the structure of IL-10 and other members of the IL-10 family of cytokines. IFN-λR1 consists of two distinct domains having fibronectin type III topology. The ligand-receptor interface includes helix A, loop AB, and helix F on the IFN site, as well as loops primarily from the N-terminal domain and inter-domain hinge region of IFN-λR1. Composition and architecture of the interface that includes only a few direct hydrogen bonds support an idea that long-range ionic interactions between ligand and receptor govern the process of initial recognition of the molecules while hydrophobic interactions finalize it.

This paper estimates the daily change of R and the detection rate simultaneously using a Bayesian model. The analysis using synthesized data shows that our model correctly estimates R and detects a short-term shock of the detection rate. Then, we apply our model to data from several countries to evaluate the effectiveness of public healthcare measures. Our analysis focuses Japan, which employs a moderate measure to keep ""social distance"". The result indicates a downward trend and now R becomes below 1. Although our analysis is preliminary, this may suggest that a moderate policy still can prevent epidemic of COVID-19."	The method used in this paper has several limitations. First, as experiment used simulation data revealed, our method cannot determine the true level of detection rate, nor its long-term trends. To find the true detection rate, we need different kind of data, such as excess mortality. Second, our model uses a naive SIR model and does not consider incubation period and reporting delay. We can reconstruct the date of exposure by back projection, so it would be interesting apply our method to such data.|

Here, we analyze the patterns of inflammatory cytokines, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in order to determine fl their diagnostic value. Methods: This was a prospective study of 658 patients admitted with CAP. PCT and CRP were analyzed by immunoluminometric and immunoturbidimetric assays. Cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a ], IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) were measured using enzyme immunoassay. Results: The lowest medians of CRP, PCT, TNF-a, and IL-6 were found in CAP of unknown cause, and the highest were found in patients with positive blood cultures. Different cytokine profiles fi and biomarkers were found depending on cause: atypical bacteria (lower PCT and IL-6), viruses (lower PCT and higher IL-10), Enterobacteriaceae (higher IL-8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (high PCT), and Legionella pneumophila (higher CRP and TNF-a). PCT Ն 0.36 mg/dL to predict positive blood cultures showed sensitivity of 85%, specifi city of 42%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98%, whereas a cutoff of Յ 0.5 mg/dL to predict viruses or atypicals vs bacteria showed sensitivity of 89%/81%, specifi city of 68%/68%, positive predictive value of 12%/22%, and NPV of 99%/97%. In a multivariate Euclidean distance model, the lowest infl ammatory expression fl was found in unknown cause and the highest was found in L pneumophila, S pneumoniae , and Enterobacteriaceae. Atypical bacteria exhibit an infl ammatory pattern closer to that of viruses. Conclusions: Different infl ammatory patterns elicited by different microorganisms may provide a useful tool for diagnosis. Recognizing these patterns provides additional information that may facilitate a broader understanding of host infl ammatory response to microorganisms.	Not all microbiologic studies were performed on the whole population and unknown cause may correspond to underdiagnosed viruses or bacteria. |

The vast amount of data concerning the structureeactivity relationship for Mannich bases derived from structurally diverse substrates has added to previous knowledge, thus allowing better insight into the design of more effective drug candidates based on the aminomethylation reaction in the future. Tremendous progress has been made in the field of anticancer agents and antimicrobials, and the last decade has witnessed the chemical modification of many biologically-active, naturally-occurring substrates or well established drugs by means of the Mannich reaction with a view to improve their biological activity. As such, the Mannich reaction has earned its rightful place as a powerful tool in medicinal chemistry, both for the synthesis of novel chemical entities endowed with various and interesting biological properties, and for the modification of physico-chemical properties of a candidate, that ultimately influence the candidate's biodisponibility, performance and pharmacological activity as a drug.|
962	44ac98826d6878ded5664f67d59cbd25269b71df	A novel conserved family of Macro-like domains-putative new players in ADP-ribosylation signaling	"The presence of many completely uncharacterized proteins, even in well-studied organisms such as humans, seriously hampers a full understanding of the functioning of living cells. One such example is the human protein C12ORF4, which belongs to the DUF2362 family, present in many eukaryotic lineages and conserved in metazoans. The only functional information available on C12ORF4 (Chromosome 12 Open Reading Frame 4) is its involvement in mast cell degranulation and its being a genetic cause of autosomal intellectual disability. Bioinformatics analysis of the DUF2362 family provides strong evidence that it is a novel member of the Macro clan/superfamily. Sequence similarity analysis versus other representatives of the Macro superfamily of ADP-ribose-binding proteins and mapping sequence conservation on predicted three-dimensional structure provides hypotheses regarding the molecular function for members of the DUF2362 family. For example, the available functional data suggest a possible role for C12ORF4 in ADP-ribosylation signaling in asthma and related inflammatory diseases. This novel family appears to be a likely novel ADP-ribosylation ""reader"" and ""eraser,"" a previously unnoticed putative new player in cell signaling by this emerging post-translational modification."

963	87b2f2205b9dea38eeaeddd6e3ddbb6e45f542ae	Genome-Wide Transcriptional Profiling Reveals Two Distinct Outcomes in Central Nervous System Infections of Rabies Virus	Rabies remains a major public health concern in many developing countries. The precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown, though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction. Mice that received intranasal inoculation of an attenuated rabies virus (RABV) strain HEP-Flury exhibited subtle clinical signs, and eventually recovered, which is different from the fatal encephalitis caused by the virulent RABV strain CVS-11. To understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance, we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. HEP-Flury or CVS-11 intranasally inoculated mice. Our results revealed that both RABV strains altered positively and negatively the expression levels of many host genes, including genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation and cell death. It is found that HEP-Flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, and the innate immunity pre-activated by HEP-Flury or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection can effectively prevent the CVS-11 to invade central nervous system (CNS), but fails to clear the CVS-11 after its entry into the CNS. In addition, following CVS-11 infection, genes implicated in cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up-regulated, while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down-regulated. On the other hand, several genes involved in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the HEP-Flury infection as compared with the CVS-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of CD4 + T cells and MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated RABV from the CNS. The differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post-exposure treatment window for RABV infection.	Altogether, our results provide a broader view of the interplay between the RABV and the host. Virulent CVS-11 infection causes extensive inflammation, immune responses and nervous system dysfunction and induces many more altered genes than attenuated HEP-Flury infection. Once the infection is established, HEP-Flury, but not the CVS-11, can be effectively suppressed by innate immunity and cleared from the CNS prior to the induction of adaptive immunity. In the CVS-11 infected mouse brains, the expression of MHC class II and activation of CD4 + T cells were impaired, resulting in the failure to stimulate the VNAs and revealing a mechanism of immune suppression of the pathogenic RABVs. Genomic transcriptional analysis is an effective technique but not enough on its own to define the critical causes and effects of virus-host interactions. Extensive studies in different regulatory levels, using different RABV strains and inoculation routes are warranted in future investigations. |

As new disease causing viruses are emerging rapidly, new alignment schemes with the advent of fast computers have gained its importance recently. In this paper, we have proposed a block based semi-global alignment scheme to evaluate the optimal alignment between any given two DNA sequences. DNA sequences are divided into blocks of equal length and alignment between the block is determined using dynamic programming. The performances are evaluated in terms of overall matrix score and percentage of similarity. It is inferred from the results, that higher the percentage of similarity between any two blocks, it may code for the same protein/amino acids. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is much less compared to that of the general global alignment scheme with O (M, N).	This paper discusses a block based semi-global alignment scheme (BGA).Two DNA categories, namely, plant species and disease causing virus are used and the base pairs were divided into different blocks of equal length. Dynamic programming with inclusion of gaps was used to evaluate the overall matrix score and percentage of strings similarity. It has been found that as the block size increases, overall matrix score tends to become more negative and hence results in less similarity between the strings. It has been further shown the computation time requires for implementing the algorithm seems to be less for small block sizes and further has to be tested with large databases for obtaining the optimization for alignment between the DNA sequence. It can be concluded that by using this BGA algorithm the structure and function of protein for the unknown sequence can be predicted with less computational time.|

However, the effect of SV5-P/V gene mutations on virus growth and adaptive immune responses in animals has not been determined. Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses. In mouse cells, in vitro studies identified a panel of SV5-P/V mutants that ranged in their ability to limit IFN responses. Intranasal infection of mice with these WT and P/V mutant viruses elicited equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses at all doses tested, and viral titers recovered from the respiratory tract were indistinguishable. In primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts, WT rSV5 and P/V-CPI-viruses had phenotypes similar to those established in human cell lines, including differential induction of IFN secretion, IFN signaling and apoptosis. Intranasal infection of ferrets with a low dose of WT rSV5 elicited ~500 fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses compared to the P/V-CPI-mutant, and this correlated with overall higher viral titers for the WT virus in tracheal tissues. There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody response to infection of ferrets with P/V-CPI-, but not with WT rSV5. Together our data indicate that WT rSV5 and P/V mutants can elicit distinct innate and adaptive immunity phenotypes in the ferret animal model system, but not in the mouse system. We present a model for the effect of P/V gene substitutions on SV5 growth and immune responses in vivo.	Induction of the IFN-β promoter.

Myeloid cells such as neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages are major innate leukocytes that orchestrate protective immunity to viral lung infections. However, a dysregulated cytokine response can promote excessive infiltration and robust pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils and monocytemacrophages, leading to fatal disease. Following virus infection, the beneficial or deleterious role of infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages is determined largely by their ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A majority of studies use the total number of infiltrating cells and their activation status as measures to demonstrate their role during an infection. Consequently, the ability of neutrophils and Inflammatory Monocyte Macrophages (IMMs) to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and its correlation with the disease severity, is not well defined. In this chapter, we report useful markers to identify lung infiltrating innate immune cells and define their activation status. We also describe a simple method to measure intracellular cytokine production to evaluate the inflammatory activity of neutrophils and IMMs in a mouse model of human coronavirus infection.	10. For best results, cells should be acquired in flow cytometer within 1-2 days post-staining.|

Method: Following Arksey and O'Malley's framework for a scoping review, five English databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, Web of Science and CINAHL) and two Chinese ones (CNKI and WanFang) were systematically searched, identifying both reports of surveys and evaluation of interventions from Jan 1997 to Oct 2018. Results: MHL research has developed rapidly in China in terms of numbers of studies and geographic coverage over the past two decades. There were 350 peer-reviewed publications included in this review, covering diverse settings and participants. Of these publications, 313 (89.4%) were published in Chinese-language journals and 37 in English-language journals; 303 (86.6%) reported on survey findings and 47 reported on the evaluation of MHL interventions. MHL research in China has mainly focused on the assessment of mental health-related knowledge and beliefs. Much less attention has been given to developing and evaluating relevant interventions. MHL related to general mental health and suicide were most commonly studied, with less focus on specific disorders, although some studies covered depression, psychosis and anxiety disorders. The majority of MHL tools utilized in the studies reported in this review were developed in China (n = 97, 80.2% ) and almost half of these studies (57.8%) did not provide enough details concerning psychometrics. Conclusions: More interventions targeting the general public and aiming to improve MHL and promote behaviour change, are needed in China. These should be evaluated with high-quality study designs, such as randomised controlled trials. Proper validation of tools used for measuring MHL should also be addressed in future studies.

Evidence from Macau	"It is commonly believed that being listed on the World Heritage List (WHL) results in attracting more tourists. However, this assumption has not been generally subject to rigorous econometric approach in the existing literature. To fill this gap, we assess the impact of the accreditation World Heritage status on the ""Historic Centre of Macau"" in 2005 on visitor numbers to the territory to identify the real effect of WHL on fostering tourism. In doing so, because of the policy restrictions on the mainland Chinese tourists, such tourists have been excluded from the analysis. The empirical results indicate that there is no significant effect of WHL on promoting tourism other than possibly a short-run tourism-enhancing impact. Notably, this effect is particularly relevant to Asian tourists. This paper discusses these results in the wider context of econometric analyses of tourism."	"Overall, we found no significant impact of WHL inscription on inducing more tourist arrivals in Macau, supporting the argument in Cellini (2011) that the effect of the presence of spots in WHL on attracting more tourists is minor. Importantly, we find some appealing results through further examinations on the year effect and region-effect of tourism caused by the WHL. First, announcement of inscribing a site on the WHL seems to be an effective advertisement and promotion strategy stimulating more tourist arrivals in the short-run. Second, the tourism-enhancing effect of the WHL is different among countries and regions. In particular, the inscription of the ""Historic Centre of Macau"" exhibits a significant impact on fostering more Asian tourists to Macau, especially for visitors from Southeast Asia, because the Portuguesestyle architecture and culture appeal more to Asian travelers than to Western tourists. Finally, Macau is a special case with only one WHS. As a result, our empirical findings cannot apply to all sites of WHL. Indeed, whether a spot listed on WHL can attract more international visitors needs supporting infrastructures and facilities within the enlisted country. However, Macau acts as an excellent case for us to avoid problems associated with the time-invariant property of WHL variables in fixed-effects models. In this manner, our results are reliable and can lend insights on the impact of UNESCO recognition on tourism.|"

Mutations in the regulatory site where the shift takes place demonstrate that the expression in vivo occurs in a programmed way. Further, we identify a full-length product of fucA1 in S.solfataricus extracts, which translate this gene in vitro by following programmed À1 frameshifting. This is the first experimental demonstration that this kind of recoding is present in Archaea.	We have experimentally shown here, for the first time, that programmed À1 frameshifting is present in the Archaea domain. This finding is the missing piece in the puzzle of the phylogenetic distribution of programmed frameshifting demonstrating that this mechanism is universally conserved.|

Nevertheless there isn't a joint agreement on the management of this condition. Some authors recommend to perform a microbiological investigation in suspected bacterial cases in order to treat the confirmed cases with antibiotics so to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. Differently, other authors consider pharyngitis, even streptococcal one, a benign, self-limiting disease. Consequently they wouldn't routinely perform microbiological tests and, pointing to a judicious use of antibiotics, they would reserve antimicrobial treatment to well-selected cases. It has been calculated that the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one complication after upper respiratory tract infections (including sore throat), was over 4000. Even the use of the Centor score, in order to evaluate the risk of streptococcal infection, is under debate and the interpretation of the test results may vary considerably. Penicillin is considered all over the world as first line treatment, but oral amoxicillin is also accepted and, due to its better palatability, can be a suitable option. Macrolides should be reserved to the rare cases of proved allergy to β-lactams. Cephalosporins can be used in patients allergic to penicillin (with the exception of type I hypersensibility) and have been also proposed to treat the relapses.	To date no Italian guideline is available, but we believe that it should be fundamental to establish a rational and uniform approach to the management of acute GABHS pharyngitis in all the country. |

Inhibition of coiled coil-mediated interactions using bioactive peptides that replicate an α-helical chain from the viral fusion machinery has significant antiviral potential. Here, we present the construction of a series of lipopeptides composed of a de novo heptad repeat sequence-based α-helical peptide plus a hydrocarbon tail. Promisingly, the constructs adopted stable α-helical conformations and exhibited relatively broad-spectrum antiviral activities against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and influenza A viruses (IAVs). Together, these findings reveal a new strategy for relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drug discovery by relying on the tunability of the α-helical coiled-coil domains present in all class I fusion proteins and the amphiphilic nature of the individual helices from this multihelix motif.

One such family are the interferons (IFNs), a family of cytokines that are involved in several cellular functions. Type I IFNs are appreciated to be important in several viral and bacterial diseases, while the recently identified type III IFNs (IFNL1, IFNL2, IFNL3, IFNL4) have been studied primarily in the context of viral infection. Viral and bacterial infections however are not mutually exclusive, and often the presence of a viral pathogen increases the pathogenesis of bacterial infection. The role of type III IFN in bacterial and viral-bacterial co-infections has just begun to be explored. In this mini review we discuss type III IFN signaling and its role in microbial pathogenesis with an emphasis on the work that has been conducted with bacterial pathogens.	Although only recently discovered compared to the rest of the interferon family, type III IFNs have already shown to play roles in viral and bacterial infections. Type III IFN therapy is undergoing clinical trials with hepatitis C infection and polymorphisms in human in IFNL3 can predict improved outcomes to therapy. Type III IFN induces a similar repertoire of genes as type I IFN over a prolonged period of time. Several studies have identified that bacterial pathogens can activate the type III IFNs. Clinical data and the use of knockout mice have identified several pathogens that appear to flourish when type III IFN is induced. These data indicate type III IFN signaling as a novel pathway for potential host immunomodulation in an era where antibiotic resistance is of increasing concern and over exuberant host responses contribute to morbidity and mortality.|

The optimal pH and temperature of the 3C-like protease for the proteolytic activity were 8.6 and 37 • C, respectively. Increased concentration (∼100 mM) of monovalent cations such as Na + and K + was inhibitory to the activity. Hg 2+ and Zn 2+ remarkably inhibited the protease activity, while Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ had no virtual effect. Several sulfhydryl reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, methyl methanethiosulfonate, N-ethylmaleimide and N-phenylmaleimide also blocked the activity, confirming the previous result that cysteine residue(s) were responsible for the proteolysis.	The optimal pH for the proteolytic reaction by the Chiba virus 3C-like protease was around 8.6, which is much more alkaline than physiological pH (Fig. 2) . The 3C-like protease was sensitive to increased concentrations of Na + (Fig. 4A ). In addition, high concentrations of K + , which is abundant inside the cell in a normal state, were also inhibitory to the activity (data not shown). The presence of Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ did not affect the activity at all (Fig. 4B) . These features might suggest that the 3C-like protease is localized and works in a limited environment inside the infected cells, rather than spreading throughout the cells. More information is necessary to elucidate when and where the 3C-like protease does work in the infected cell. We have previously shown that the active site of the Chiba virus 3C-like protease is composed of Cys139 and His30 (Someya et al., 2002) . As expected, sulfhydryl reagents as well as Hg 2+ and Zn 2+ inhibited the activity of the 3C-like protease, although the degree of inhibition varied dependent on the sulfhydryl reagents used. Small (Hg 2+ , Zn 2+ , and MMTS) and hydrophobic (NEM and NPM) reagents tended to inhibit the activity more strongly than hydrophilic reagents (PCMB and PCMBS) (Fig. 5) . This tendency may reflect the environment of the active site. The present results provide the basic biochemical features of the Norovirus 3C-like protease.|

Its main protease (M pro ) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free M pro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 M pro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 M pro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of M pro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 M pro . * Correspondence to estrada66@unizar.es 1 of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the effects of powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the protein. We think that these findings may help in the design of new potent anti-SARS CoV-2 inhibitors.	The data that supports the findings of this study are available within the article [and its supplementary material].|

The COIVD-19 epidemic among medical staff in our department was deemed as postoperative rather than intraoperative transmission, and attributed to not applying sufficient personal airway protection. Proper personal protective equipment and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic since the initial outbreak. Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries are feasible since COVID-19 is still supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with sufficient personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. However, we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might put patients in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.|

Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population,	Other studies have reported conflicting results. A study in 122 cities in China demonstrated that when the mean temperature (lag 0-14) was below 3 °C, the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased by 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209, 6.513%) for every 1 °C rise in temperature (Xie and Zhu, 2020) .

Recent studies have identified three membrane-active regions in the S2 domain of SARS-CoV glycoprotein, one situated downstream of the minimum furin cleavage, which is considered the fusion peptide (SARS FP ), an internal fusion peptide located immediately upstream of the HR1 region (SARS IFP ) and the pre-transmembrane domain (SARS PTM ). We have explored the capacity of these selected membraneinteracting regions of the S2 SARS-CoV fusion protein, alone or in equimolar mixtures, to insert into the membrane as well as to perturb the dipole potential of the bilayer. We show that the three peptides interact with lipid membranes depending on lipid composition and experiments using equimolar mixtures of these peptides show that different segments of the protein may act in a synergistic way suggesting that several membrane-active regions could participate in the fusion process of the SARS-CoV.	It has been suggested that other class I fusion proteins might utilize similar motifs to hide and control the membrane-active sequences within metastable structures. In this way, in SARS-CoV, SARS PTM and SARS FP might be forming a complex in the pre-fusion state: just after exposing the fusion peptide and its insertion into the host membrane, the formation of the six-helix bundle would bring into close proximity the region immediately upstream of HR1 (SARS IFP ) and the pre-transmembrane domain (SARS PTM ). They would find the appropriate platform in the existent lipid rafts to facilitate their interaction, and therefore facilitating the membrane fusion process. Lipid rafts are functional membrane microdomains where sphingolipids, cholesterol and associated proteins are enriched. They have been shown to play a crucial role in many biological events requiring the integrity of raft microdomains [61, 62] . In addition, many viruses often use lipid rafts as a site for entry, assembly and budding. Lipid rafts have been reported to be implicated in the entry process of HIV [63] , Semliki Forest virus [64] and simian virus 40 [65] . In the case of coronavirus, there also some evidence that lipid rafts are involved in virus entry [66, 67] . Recent studies have reported that lipid rafts are involved in SARS-CoV entry into cells, although it is not clear if ACE2 directly localize in rafts or not. Therefore, it has been proposed that some unknown factors involved in virus entry may localize to lipid rafts [7] . In the present work, we have showed that some regions of the SARS-CoV S2 glycoprotein, mainly SARS PTM and SARS IFP , can have a different interaction with lipid rafts. Consequently, lipid rafts might serve as a platform for several regions in native spike glycoprotein to interact and facilitate the membrane fusion process. In this way, lipid rafts induce and modulate the joining of components of the membrane [32, 34, [45] [46] [47] . (A) The FP (yellow) inserts into the host cell, it is followed by the formation of the prehairpin intermediate, and the core formed by the HR1 (orange) and HR2 (green) is refolded into the six-helix bundle. (B) Subsequently hemifusion is induced, this process being facilitated by the juxtaposition of the IFP (blue) and PTM (red) domains. These two regions could also facilitate the formation of the fusion pore through lipid destabilization in the late steps of the membrane fusion process, (C) leading to the complete fusion. docking and fusion machinery making possible their intermolecular interactions by proximity [68, 69] .|

There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV infections. Potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models. The aged BALB/c mouse model for SARS supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimics SARS in the elderly. We tested two preventive strategies, vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody, to determine the extent of protection achieved against SARS-CoV challenge in this model. These approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody titers sufficient to reduce viral load, protect from weight loss, and reduce or eliminate histopathologic changes in the lungs of aged mice. This study validates the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis.	Pre-challenge neutralizing antibody titer in serum (log|

TYMV encodes a precursor replication polyprotein that is processed by the endoproteolytic activity of its internal cysteine proteinase domain (PRO). We recently reported that PRO is actually a multifunctional enzyme with a specific ubiquitin hydrolase (DUB) activity that contributes to viral infectivity. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 150-residue PRO. Strikingly, PRO displays no homology to other processing proteinases from positive-stranded RNA viruses, including that of alphaviruses. Instead, the closest structural homologs of PRO are DUBs from the Ovarian tumor (OTU) family. In the crystal, one molecule's C-terminus inserts into the catalytic cleft of the next, providing a view of the N-terminal product complex in replication polyprotein processing. This allows us to locate the specificity determinants of PRO for its proteinase substrates. In addition to the catalytic cleft, at the exit of which the active site is unusually pared down and solvent-exposed, a key element in molecular recognition by PRO is a lobe N-terminal to the catalytic domain. Docking models and the activities of PRO and PRO mutants in a deubiquitylating assay suggest that this N-terminal lobe is also likely involved in PRO's DUB function. Our data thus establish that DUBs can evolve to specifically hydrolyze both iso-and endopeptide bonds with different sequences. This is achieved by the use of multiple specificity determinants, as recognition of substrate patches distant from the cleavage sites allows a relaxed specificity of PRO at the sites themselves. Our results thus shed light on how such a compact protein achieves a diversity of key functions in viral genome replication and host-pathogen interaction.	Text S1 Supplementary protocols and figures.

The 2-5As bind and activate the RNase L, an endoRNase degrading viral and cellular RNA leading to inhibition of viral replication. The 2-5A system is tightly controlled by synthesis and degradation of 2-5As. Whereas synthesis is mediated by the 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase family of enzymes, degradation seems to be orchestrated by multiple enzyme nucleases including phosphodiesterase 12, the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 and the A-kinase anchoring protein 7.

In this study, we prepared two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; 1C3 and 4C7) directed against the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) M protein. The 1C3 and 4C7 mAbs both reacted with the native TGEV M protein in western blotting and immunofluorescence (IFA) assays. Two linear epitopes, 243YSTEART249 (1C3) and 243YSTEARTDNLSEQEKLLHMV262 (4C7), were identified in the endodomain of the TGEV M protein. The 1C3 mAb can be used for the detection of the TGEV M protein in different assays. An IFA method for the detection of TGEV M protein was optimized using mAb 1C3. Furthermore, the ability of the epitope identified in this study to stimulate antibody production was also evaluated. An immunodominant epitope in the TGEV membrane protein endodomain was identified. The results of this study have implications for further research on TGEV replication.	Two specific mAbs against the TGEV M protein (1C3 and 4C7) were prepared in this study, and two linear B cell epitopes located in the M protein endodomain were successfully identified. The 1C3 mAb was used to immunoprecipitate the M protein from TGEV-infected PK-15 cell lysates. The 1C3 mAb is a useful tool for investigations of the antigenic properties of the M protein. These antibodies are relevant to furthering our understanding of the mechanism of the M protein in TGEV replication. Furthermore, an immunodominant epitope (aa 243-262) in the TGEV membrane protein endodomain was identified.|

The detailed biological features of this attenuated virus remain to be further investigated. Experimental inoculation with EIAV DLV121 did not result in clinical symptoms even with immunosuppressive treatment in our previous studies. Here, we further investigated whether the replication of the vaccine strain EIAV DLV121 in experimentally infected horses causes histopathological lesions to develop in the targeted organs. Both the lungs and the spleen have been demonstrated to support EIAV replication. By evaluating the gross macroscopic and histological changes, we found that EIAV DLV121 did not cause detectable histopathological lesions and that it replicated several hundred times more slowly than its parental virulent strain, EIAV LN40 , in tissues. Immunochemical assays of these tissues indicated that the primary target cells of EIAV DLV121 were monocytes/macrophages, but that EIAV LN40 also infected alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. In addition, both of these viral strains promoted the up-and down-regulation of the expression of various cytokines and chemokines, implicating the potential involvement of these cellular factors in the pathological outcomes of EIAV infection and host immune responses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the EIAV vaccine strain does not cause obvious histopathological lesions or clinical symptoms and that it induces a unique cytokine response profile. These features are considered essential for EIAV DLV121 to function as an effective live vaccine.	All authors report that there were no conflicts of interest in the preparation of this manuscript.|

The quest to understand and prevent their spreading dates more than two centuries. Over the years, advances in Medicine, Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Network Science, Computer Science, and Technology in general contributed to the development of modern epidemiology. In this chapter, we present a summary of different mathematical and computational approaches aimed at describing, modeling, and forecasting the diffusion of viruses. We start from the basic concepts and models in an unstructured population and gradually increase the realism by adding the effects of realistic contact structures within a population as well as the effects of human mobility coupling different subpopulations. Building on these concepts we present two realistic data-driven epidemiological models able to forecast the spreading of infectious diseases at different geographical granularities. We conclude by introducing some recent developments in diseases modeling rooted in the bigdata revolution.	In this chapter, we present a brief review not only of the fundamental mathematical tools and concepts of epidemiology but also of some of the state-of-the-art and computational approaches aimed at describing, modeling, and forecasting the diffusion of viruses. Our focus was on the developments occurring over the past decade that are sure to form the foundation for developments in decades to come.|
